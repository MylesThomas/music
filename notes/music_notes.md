John Summit 4 minute video

Main elements in tech house:

Kick
Fat 909 w/ short tail (to leave space for the bass)
909 Kick
Bass
-Made in Ableton’s operator
-Saw D wave for added harmonics
-Raise envelope to 50%
-Lower frequency to 100Hz
Base midi:
-Write notes on 1/16th note grid
-In general, you want phrase 1-4 bars long
-This track is E minor (Notes E/F#)
-Most house songs are written in minor key
-Also, added pitch bend for movement
Bass processing:
-Added drum bus for distortion/compression
-Added compressor to sidecbain the bass to the kick
-Added EQ to take out resonance / unwanted lowend
-Added filter to take out unwanted highs and mids

Hats
Likes to use multiple layers that cover the stereo spectrum
-Left hat
-Right hat
-Center hat
-Wide shaker
-Syncopated hat (for added swing)
-Extra hat (for variation)

Claps
Note: claps are more midrange focused so center clap is more dominant
-Center layer
-Wide layer
-texture layer
Link to article: The stock 707, 808, and 909 clap samples are definitely a good starting place and are classic sounds used throughout house music.
First downloaded Drum Hit -707 Clap but Roland TR-707 Clap could work too (or Lo-Fi Pack - 707 Clap)

Percussion
Highly recommend using a variety of sounds!
(Makes beat more interesting and dynamic)
Sometimes percussion is really full
This track is more stripped down, just has syncopated hits and extra sounds

Synth/FX
Like to use sounds that keep the track interesting, while not taking it away from the groove (The groove is king, don’t add too many effects)
Every four bars:
-Uplifter
-Noise hit
-Acid synth/break
-Also added vinyl texture layer for added ambiance

Vocals
(optional, but who doesn’t love a good vocal)

Changing the session key- The session key menu matches the Sampler to your song's key (pressing the lock button preserves your selected key and applies it to everything you preview/play)

Download Sting 2022
https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8357/sting-by-iftah-a-really-nice-acid-line-generator

Double click on the download file (.amxd) to have it appear in Ableton

1. Insert new MIDI track
2. Grab a bass from sample pack (Pick one in C, can always tune it back w/ tranpose)
3.

Westend

1. Add in a Kick

- 1/1.2/1.3/1.4

2. Use SPAN (Voxengo SPAN/LOW) to find what Key the Kick is in

- Put in high res mode, look for where peak is (in video he finds it to be G#, so he will write the rest of track in G#)

3. Add in a Clap

- 1.2/1.4
- Want short/punchy claps (leave no tail)
- Fade down to halfway between 1.2 and 1.2.3
- Bring volume down on clap - He put a -4.5 into the light blue highlighted area on right

4. Add in another clap

- -8.8 volume

5. Add in a Hat

- He says "get a nice open hat"
- 1 Hat: Make a little shorter (from 1.1.3 to halfway to 1.2, and fade down a bit)
- 2 Hat at 1.2.3: Leave as is (goes to 1.3)
  (This helps add a groove)

6. Add in a closed hat

- Open hat is dead a bit at the beginning. A closed hat comes on and brings more energy
- He adds the closed hat to wherever there is the first hat

7. Start working on baseline

- He pulls out 'Easy tech baseline' which has Sting64, Sylenth, EQ Eight, Utility, Tuner
- Make sure Sting 2013/2022 is loaded in (I just double-clicked from Downloads)
- Insert 2 empty MIDI tracks
- Highlight both of them, right click, 'Group tracks'
- I now have a group called 'Bass', then 'BASS 1' and 'BASS 2'

- Change input for BASS #2 to BASS #1 (We are recording the MIDI from that channel, into BASS #2)
- Hit record and watch the MIDI fill the screen

1. Warp Vocals
2. 128 BPM
3. 2 FM sine waves hard left + hard right (to give stereo feel) with a filter to automate the cutoff
4. EQ (EQ Eight) to take all lows out of the bass
5. Chorus for width
6. Reverb to make it sounds smoother
7. OTT (??)
8. Glue Compressor - Sidechain technique (Every time the kick hits, the vocals will duck down)

- We want to emphasize the floor to the floor drum pattern

10. Add some hats
11. Create a simple build-up (Go to 3:30 for help)

Section 8: Mixing the Drums

67. Kick Drum EQ
    Purpose: Most important mixing tool: Kick is most important part of drums and entire mix, so

plugin: EQ Eight

- Expression of the sound + A way to fix problems + Also a way to get creative / design your sounds

1. Make sure all the bass and other stuff is off
2. Start with Audio Effects -> EQ Eight
3. question: Should I be low cutting my kicks/basses?
   answer: it depends
   IF: when mastering, we want to get it as loud as possible

- Need to remove anything in the sounds/frequenceis that is not needed
- Should be cutting MORE than you should be boosting
  IF: when mastering, we want a track that is not meant to be as loud
- ie. chill house / deep house (This is where we want low frequencies / rumbling sounds)
- do not cut your low kicks and bases!
- (the more you low cut, the more the high frequencies come out)
  (this is noise that prevents from getting the loud track we all want)
- soft = low frequences, not a lot of top end
- aggressive = more mid-range, high frequencies

4. Imagine how you want your drums to sound (there is no right/wrong)

- Cutting through the mix = Kick drum punching through the mix

Guidlines for getting started:

1. Figure out how much you want to low-cut

- Take your cue value (1) and boost it up quite a bit
- Sweep that point to the right
  --- At some point, it's going to sound a lot better
- Finally, adjust cue back down (so you don't introduce way to much bottom end that the kick drum is 'muddy'

2.  Take cue value (2) all the way down

- It appears to be at the ground, 3 gray dashes away from 1k
- 90% of the time there is an issue between 500-1000 Hz (weird box-y frequency)
- Cutting it out will clean up the kick drum and make it fit better in your mix

4. optional: (try it out) Move cue value (3) up for a boost to the top-end

5. Kick Drum Compression
   Purpose: helps control/get more punch+power/add attack
   plugin: s(M)exoscope
   --- Using the plugin:
   ---- Setting stage: Beginning part of kick is lower than the top/boomy part of the kick
   (The compressor comes in and lets through parts of the audio, then compresses everything else - The part(s) that are not compressed become louder!)
   ---- 1. Zoom in with 'Amp' (our goal is to make the beginning level with the peak ie. attack being same volume as boomy part))
   ---- 2. Click on top right corner of the attack
   ----- Write down the following:
   ----- y value (threshold for the Compressor, which is bottom left right by release knob)
   ----- x value (will subtract this value from the x value for peak)
   ---- 3. Click at beginning of wave form
   ----- Write down the following: x value
   ---- 4. Compressor's 'attack' = Subtract 2x from 3x (1.14 - 1.09 = 0.05s = 5milliseconds)
   ---- 5. Adjust release
   ----- Quicker release: the snappier the sound will be (too fast = distortion issues)
   ----- Slower release: the smoother it will be (too slow = always compressing)
   ----- Note: if it is too slow, the compressor is always on
   ---- 6. Adjust ratio (this changes how strong the compressor is - Inf:1 is very strong/brick wall)
   ----- Inf:1 = Snappy vs. 2:1 = Warm/Balanced (this is up to you)
   ---- 7. Make sure volume goes back to un-compressed volume before next kick
   ---- 8. Use Voxengo SPAN to make sure the dB is loduer with the compressor
   ----- Add makeup gain by raising the arrow on the right up (You can lose volume when using the compressor - this compensates)
   ---- 9.

6. Kick Drum Distrotion
   Purpose: Kick sounds fatter in lower frequencies / Sounds more open / Hear the attack better

plugin: Saturator (preferred for Ableton users)

- 1. Open up s(M)exoscope and play the kick
- 2. Pause
- 3. Click on bottom of big peak (the stuff you want removed)
     -- Write down the y value (dB)
     -- This threshold is the highest dB that you don't want cut off
- 4. Open Saturator plugin
- 5. Set the 'Drive' and 'Output' to the threshold from #3
- 6. optional: set Soft Clip to 'on' and play around till distortion is not too much

plugin: Waveshaper (Hard clipping = Hard clipping, Soft clipping = Saturate)

Hard clipping: Snipping off peaks

- Dry/Wet of 1 = 100%
- Threshold: How deep you are cutting with your scissors (where you are cutting off the peaks)
  --- Threshold of 0.1 = Completely flattens the kick
  (you can hear distortion - you probably don't want to do to hear the distortion and instead want it to be clean)
  --- We want the crazy peak from the beginning gone

Soft clipping: More curved/gentle (kinda like sanding off peaks and transients)

- Pre Gain: is like pushing the volume into a wall
- Post Gain: brings the overall volume back down

70. Kick Drum Limiting
    Purpose: Final insurance policy to make sure the kick drum stays in place

- We want the kick drum to hit the exact same peak level, all the time (no fluctuation)
- We use a limiter at the end of the chain to do so

plugin: Limiter

1. Click the top of the kick (-14.2 dB)
2. Set the output 'Ceiling' down to #1's value to crush the kick one last time

- It makes sure the kick stays in place
- Tells the sounds "You will not go over -14.2 dB, no matter what happens)
  --- The peak should now be smashed, although it will take away some of the kick

3. Lookahead: tells the limiter how far ahead of time to look for incoming peak

- The longer you give the limiter time, the less distortion you will have
- Won't be as loud / punchy as when you use a short lookahead time

4. Release:
5. Group all (Compressor/Saturator/Limiter) together

- This is to volume match
- This is so powerful because ...

6. Compare the peak volume before/after all the plugins via Voxengo SPAN

- With all the plugins on, volume goes 6 dB lower (-14 initially, then it's -8 after)

7. Volume match to fix the discrepancy in #6

- Add Utility plugin
- Add 6 dB of gain to it
  --- We should now have same dB before/after all of the plugins being on the kick

8. Even though they are at the same dB for peak volume, you'll hear the plugins one sounding louder and fuller
   --- This is the secret to getting loudness
   ---- Getting rid of frequencies
   ---- Making sure the sound has enough punch/power
   ---- Making sure the peaks are under control
9. Turn Limiter on master channel back on

Section 13: Reverb and Delay

Warping tracks:
Part 1:

1. Load it into an audio track on Ableton
2. Crop to just the parts of the track/mix you want
3. Find where the kick drum starts (This is where the new '1.1.1' will be)
4. In the editor in the bottom, zoom in as close as you can to this spot and hit 'Ctrl-I'
   (This inserts a 'Warp Marker')
5. In the same editor in the bottom, go to beginning of track and remove Warp Marker (Click-Delete)
6. Right-click on correctly placed Warp Marker -> Warp from Here (Straight)

- The 1.1.1 in the bottom editor is now at this kick mark

7. (Try this step before proceding to the 'Continue') In the bottom editor, move the flag at far left to correct spot

(Continue)
Part 2:
The beginning of this warped track is probably not ready for beat matching now.

1. You should have done this before, but ensure beginning/end of this track are cropped properly
2. Move the track to (near) where you want the kick drum at 1.1.1 to go off
   (You'll probably be off by a little bit, but that is OK)
3. In the bottom editor, scroll all the way to the left of the warped track

- Make sure that in the top area, you are zoomed in close enough (and also far enough) that you'll be able to see the kick moving L/R
- Zoom in very close (ie. to the -67.1.1 and -67.1.2 lines are visible) so that any move is very miniscule
- Move the black flag L/R until in the above pane, the kick is in the perfect spot

Couldn't change BPM of a track

1. Remember that you warped it before
2. Load it in a different audio section
3. Find the warp point
4. Right click 'Warp from here at 126 BPM'

Westend - Buildups 101
(https://vimeo.com/773172994)

---

-In order to have a release, you need to have tension built up in the first place
-One of most important things: Automation
-Drum arrangements to keep them interesting / changes + continuity
-Making our own riser with a preset (they're great)
--- having your own riser can have more identity than bringing in FX from Splice
-No one right/wrong way to figure out how to make a buildup/bring tension
--- over time that will become your signature sound
PACK TO GET: Deceiver Vol 5 (Zen World) [https://www.evosounds.com/techhouseserumpresetssamples]
-Typical build-up: 16 bars (this can vary, but for tech house this is normal)

If everything is in your buildup and your drop, there is not going to be much release
-Keep some things for before, keep some for after
(song will be more engaging)

Idea: Call and response by ending a quarter bar early on 1 and 3 vs. 2 and 4 using the whole Synth

First thing: Automation

- For every sound in the buildup section, think "what can I do to create change over time"
  (Low pass filter with Auto Filter that gives more sound as we approach the drop)
- Have it so that the yellow circle in auto filter is inching from left/middle to the right
  (I think frequency is increasing)
- More higher frequencies = Clearer + crisper sound

Delay:

Drum arrangement:

- Starting out: they are running the same the whole time
- Westend likes having them come in and out (to build more tension)
  --- He took out the clap from 45-49 (says its empty now but will fill more later)

Note on:
Lead currently comes in every 4 bars
-Leave a lot of room (4 bars rn) we want something faster (8th notes)
-We like repition in house music to get into the flow on dance floor
-Try filling the empty space with female vocal hit

More automation

- Frequency Shifter: Riser type feel (good for going towards the drop)
- Erosion: Adds a nice noise texture (add an upward curve towards the drop)
- Endless smile (automation for drums): Cool, reverb/washout effect
  --- sometimes it is nice to keep some dry and put it on others ie. open hat

Making your owner riser

- More 'in your face'
  --- chris lake does this a lot, gives your build ups a lot of energy

0. insert a midi track
1. add any synth you want (Serum preferably for sound source)
   --- not a synth session, but this is where you 'make your own patches' by scratch for a riser ie. add oscilator/play with wave forms
2. draw one long/held note that goes out the full 16 bars (in the root key of the song - westend is using D here)
   --- sounds like a saw-wave at first
3. start automating a bunch of stuff (big automation curves ie. bottom to top, can fine-tune later)
   --- filter cutoff:
   --- tonal delay:
   --- reverb:
   --- lfo1/lfo2 rate: makes it go faster and faster
   ----- rate: hZ
   ----- can make it go really fast then slow down before end/drop ie. go up then back down 1/2 a bar before drop, can lead it all the way in (experiment as much as possible)
4. Downlifters and Uplifters (30:00)
   --- because we are doing this last, we are not relying on it for tension/release (they are supplementing the main idea - relying on them makes your idea basic/not solid)
5. Snare rolls (go watch his video)
   --- you can have these running the whole time ie. from start to drop (his goes from 33 to 48, drop at 49)
   ----- if it comes from the start, filter it in OR do some volume automation
   --- Westend's favorite is for it to come in halfway ie. 41 when drop is 49
   --- Kick rolls (shortened) is another type of less-beefy snare roll
   ----- mess with auto filter (automate a high pass filter to gradually hear the kick coming in) [33:20]
6. Breakbeats
   --- What you do in the last bar ie. from 48 to 49 (drop at 49) is very important
7. Effects/Crashes
   --- there are a lot of high frequencies from 45-49 (snare rolls, synths, vocals building, reverb stacking up)
   (if your drop is a little lacking it will sounds disproportionate ie. heavier w/ frequencies on left)
   ----- fix this by fx/crashes/synth shots
   ----- I like how he used a downlifter from (49-51) [35:05]
   ----- 35:45 uses a vocal from 50.3.1 to 51.1.1

Video Main Takeaway: You cannot over-automate in a build up!

1. Automation (what can i be doing on every sound to bring change)

- filters, reverb, dry/wet, pitching

2. Arrangement changes

- take things out, bring new things in (surprise listener by giving/taking away when you wouldn't guess)

3. Making your own rises
   -bring character, sets vibe and tone

Westend - Snare rolls
https://vimeo.com/564076584

---

Setup: 0. New MIDI Channel

- Goes from Bar 41-49

1. Add in 'Simpler' (Instruments -> Simpler)
2. Grab a punchy/fat snare sample and drop it into the Simpler

- We want it to have both good low and high frequencies
- Avoid thin/high samples

3. Shape the sound in Simpler

- Go to 1-shot mode
- Solo the MIDI so we can focus on this sound (We have no notes down to listen to - Circle back to this after writing the pattern)
  --- Increasing the 'Fade Out' can help (I do not have a suggested setting but it seems to sound better with it all the way up)

4. Choose the pattern you want

- Highlight Bars 41-49, Create -> Insert Empty MIDI Clips (Ctrl-Shift-M: This opens the Piano roll)
- Most common in tech house: 16th Note (Right click -> 1/16th Note)
  --- We put a note/bar down at every block
  --- Some EDM uses 8th note ie. think Audien EDM build up
- You want to keep your snare roll on C3
  --- This is the initial/root sound of the sample you choose (Note: Anything up or down is altering it)

5. Create movement in the snare roll with Velocity

- When somebody hits the drums, they do not have equal power for each hit
- Westend shows 2 ways for all 8 sections of bars from 1.1 to 3.1 (Each bar has 4 blocks ie. Bar 1 is from 1 to 1.2):
  --- 127-115-127-115 (His typical choice - can bring lower than 115)
  --- 127-112-100-115
  --- Play around, this is totally up to you for how to add movement
  -----(My first thought is to bring volume low to high)
- After finishing this, duplicate so we have 8 full bars

6. Optional: Add additional notes [4:21]

- If there is room in the build up ie. if there's a lot going on, we probably don't want snare roll doing crazy patterns
- If there is not, then your listener will be more focused on the snare roll
- Ideas:
  --- Replacing normal 2 snare roll hits with 4 shorter ones
  --- Going up a note or two on the piano for 2 hits
  --- Delete notes (makes a d-d..d-d effect)

7. EQ Eight

- Westends says he always has it on here
- There may be other high frequencies going on in the build up
- Use cases:
  --- Cut out the lows (he turns '1' into a x4 around 90)
  --- Tame the highs of the snare (he turns '8' into a x around 6-7k - just to the right/below '4') [6:30]
  --- Boost a certain area (optional: he raises the middle)

8. Low Pass Filter

- Filters sounds really good (Audio Effects -> EQ & Filters -> Auto Filter)
- You don't really want your snare roll to come in fully opened
  --- Think how John Summit's will build up over 8-16 bars
- Dull out the beginning by doing the following:
  --- Start filtered out (Frequency = 424 or even 848)
  --- Right Click -> Automation in new lane -> Automate the 'opening up' by the end of 8 bars (Frequency = 19900)
  --- Curving up (instead of linear) could work here
  --- Feel free to increase resonance (this will highlight the frequency it is on - he does it to )

9. High Pass Filter
   (We already have a low pass filter - Now to add in a high one)

- Default value for Auto Filter is the bar going straight to the right and dipping down at the end (2nd option)
- We now want option #2, the one that goes up and then continues on to the right (This is a high pass filter)
- Automate the filter:
  --- If MIDI goes from 41 to 49 (Drop at 49), Automate Frequency from 26 to 6000 between bars 48 and 49
  --- Westend doesn't do it, but this could be a parabolic automation

10. Swing:

- Take your MIDI clip, see where you can see 'Groove' on the left
- Search for 'Swing 16ths 59' in All Results on the left -> Double click /Drag into Groove area, hit 'Commit Groove' button
  --- A lot of the nodes are now off the grid, adds groove/swing/funk

11. Vocoder (optional)
    (Another way to bring movement into your snare rolls)

- Set Carrier = Noise (This will bring in white noise)
  --- Think of this like an EQ / Frequency Graph
  --- x axis:
  --- y axis: volume
  Steps:
- Automate Dry/Wet from 0-32.7% Between Bars 45-49
- Automate Formant from 0-30% Between Bars 45-49 (Puts up the noise layer and pitches it up)

12. Envelope
    (Noizu has done this ALOT in past songs)

- Note: Different than automation, as you are messing with part of the clip
- Many take everything away in fill section ie. between Bars 48-49 (Kick, drums, etc. Right before the drop)
  --- Noizu won't take it out, but he will pitch it down
  --- I like how it sounds when you pitch it up too
  --- You can also have the snare roll end at Bar 48 and avoid doing this
  Steps:
- Open piano roll again
- Open up Clip and its scroll down to Envelopes
- Make the options 'MIDI Ctrl' and 'Pitch Bend'
- Pitch the clip down between Bars 8-9
  --- This makes a triangle (Similar to how the automations will look)

13. Others

- Reverb/Delay/etc. [12:30]
- Endless Smile to add Reverb
  --- Westend says not to bring Intensity up too much (What happens is you loose the initial punch of your snare)

---

## Westend - DJ Mix

Setup: 0. Put BPM at 126 for Master

1. Limiter on Master (Audio Effects -> Dynamics -> Limiter)

- Playing multiple songs at once can cause potential clipping

2. Changing 2 Preferences regarding warping (Preferences -> Record/Warp/Launch)

- Warp all of your songs: Auto Warp Long Samples = On
- Make Complex mode the default setting for new tracks: Default Warp Mode = Complex

3. Put songs into Left Out/Right Out

- Hit 'IO' in bottom right
- Switch from Inputs to Outputs with In -> Off on the right side (near volume)

4. Fixing the problem where there is some delay (ie. track/kick not going at the start of the grid)

- Go to beginning of track and drag left to remove any beginning transient

5. Ensure that the BPM of the song you drag in is correct
6. Keeping songs on the grid

- Find where you want to start mixing out ie. the 8/16 bars you will transition
- Select the point where you want to mix out, Create -> Insert Time Signature Change

7. Label songs

- Click on where a song/phrase ends ie. intro starts at 1, 1st song starts at bar 15
- Click 'Set' in top right (it's near the automation button)
- Right click -> Rename

DJ Mixing time:

1. Automate Volume or 'Mute'

- Muted = 17 dB, Not Muted = 0 dB
- Current track: Use last 8 bars to slightly mute (only 5-8 dB is needed)
- New track: Bring from mute to fully on w/ 16 bars
- Tip: Press Alt to make automation curves parabolic instead of linear

2. Automate Lows (To fix issue of both bass's playing)

- Lows on = 0 dB, Lows off = -14 dB
- Current track: Between 16th and 1st/17th bar cut the lows (diagonally)
- New track: Right at 1st/17th bar bring the lows (vertically)

3. Automate High pass filter

- Filter on = 3.0 kHz, Filter off = 26.0 Hz
- Current track: Last 4 bars
- New track: None

4. Reverb (idk how to do this yet)

- Can use this instead of high pass filter
- Great for a sudden transition
  --- ie. First Mix where I need sudden switch from TWINSICK to What a Life
- 'Endless Smile' plugin: https://dadalife.com/new-audio-plugin-endless-smile-is-out-now
- Can use stock Ableton: https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/qlg281/endless_smile_alternative/

5. Remove automation

- It all gets carried over, make sure to reset (Right click -> Edit value -> 0 dB)

Optional tips:

- Make markers for transition points
- Cut out audio (not using delete, by sliding the top-right of track to the right)
- Automate BPM (Master -> Song Tempo)
- Highlight an area, Create -> Insert Silence

## Westend - EQ Movement Trick

Right before the drop, he currently has the following:
-Crashes (Cymbals) at 48.1, 48.2, 48.3, 48.4
-Drop at 49.1 with another crash

Problem: Sounds robotic (this issue can be seen with snare rolls, crashes, any duplicated sound)

Solution:

1. Add in EQ Eight
2. Automate '1 Frequency A'

- Start right at 2kHz/2000Hz (Where it is cutting out lows/mnids), end up around 206Hz
- In the view, the Frequency starts high and goes down in a linear fashion

## Westend - Making a track from scratch

Part 1: Making a Beat

Notes at beginning:
-Focus on the drop to start

- In tech house, the drop is going to have the following characteristics:
  --- Most of the drums
  --- Baseline
  --- Synths/other sounds to fill up the mix
- By starting with the drop, you end up with most of the elements to arrange the track
  --- Not everything, but most

Order:

0. Reference track

- Important to listen to other professional producers who do this full-time / write hits
- Study the way music is made / take ideas from them

1. Drums (groove sits on this)

Kick:
(Kick -> Low/Mid/Bassizm)

- He looks at Blanc/Zen World here
- The kick he chooses has base, and higher frequencies (you can see this in EQ Eight)
- 4 bar loop from 81 to 85: The kick hits every 1/4th bar ie. 81.1, 81.2, 81.3, 81.4, 82.1, etc.

Clap:
(Drums -> Clap -> Center/Left/Right/Texture, in the arrangement template)

- Westend usually layers his claps
  --- What this means is that 1 sample usually won't have enough frequencies / be strong enough / punchy enough
- Clap sits on the 2 and the 4 ie. 81.2, 81.4
- After laying down the first clap, he looks for another clap that is 'different' than this one
  --- If you are layering, you want diversity in the sound
  --- After finding one different, he turns down main clap (-3.8) and 2nd clap (-10.6)
  ----- One think he likes to do is bring the volume of 2nd clap very low, and bring it up until he can hear it
- You may need to bring the Clap group (so the volume for all claps) down a bit (He put his at -3.9)

Hats:
(Drums -> Hats -> Main hat -> Open/Shaker Layer/Transient, in the arrangement template)

- Might not use all, but you will hear an open High Hat in all house songs
  Open hat:
- between the 2 kicks ie. 81.1.3, 81.2.3
- Edit shape of the open clap ie. make open hat at 81.1.3 (red) shorter than 81.2.3 (yellow) then (red) at 81.3.3 and (brown) at 81.4.3 longest
  --- Little things like this add complexity to the drum groove due to the variation
- Bring volume down, we don't want it louder than the clap (Main hat is down to -4.4)
- Note: He consolidates the 8 kicks together (The ones going from 81 to 85) before moving on
  --- Shortcut for consolidating: Highlight samples -> Ctrl-J
  Shaker Lay:
- Name of .wav is HAT_curl_hit (ch-ch-ch sound)
- Helps fill in some frequencies that are not there on the Main Hat sample
  --- Play with EQ Eight around the mid frequencies
  --- Also, make sure the volume is down (right now Shaker layer is at -10.7, open is at 0, Main hat folder is at -4.4)
  Transient: none
- Westend hears not much percussion, but a faster hat (tika-tika-tika-tika, 16th notes)

Loops:
(Drums -> Hats -> Loops -> Loop/Shaker/Tamb)

- Premade patterns with a bunch of drum sounds (Quick to add since they are premade)
  --- Some people hate on loops, don't listen since all the best producers use TONS of loops
  --- No reason not to use them (you don't gain much from using your own - are powerful as long as you know what you're doing and don't stack 100 on top [15:10])
  Loop:
- Starts looking at 'Top Loops' in SOBV2 (picks SOBV@\_TOP_chicago)
- Has a bunch of hats, a snare, a big clap
- He likes to shorten each of the sounds in the loop
  --- Click on the loop -> Warp settings -> Beats Mode + Transient Reserve (both are under BPM) -> Change arrow to point right (2nd option) -> Turn value down from 100 to 35
  --- This shorters the 'sustain' of each of these drum hits (makes them shorter/less lound)
  --- Similar to with hats, pulling the every-other hat back a bit
- After consolidating, he continues
  --- Deletes the bigger clap sound, but keeps the kick (maybe we already like the clap sound we have)
  --- Brings volume down to -8.9 so it doesn't overpower the other drums
- Because of the extra hits on kick/claps, it makes our drums less 'stock sounding'
  Shaker:
- 2nd loop (more than OK to add more than one loop
- Finds evolution of sound shaker loop
  --- it has a lot of movement and volume (goes from quite to loud)
  --- He takes the loudest part (Between 81.1.3 abd 81.2.1) and duplicates that the whole way
- Shaker helps fill out higher frequencies since it is always running
- Puts volume at -11.9
- Shaker is very wide in our headphones - if we don't want it as wide, do the following:
  --- Add Utility (Utilities -> Utility) turn width down from 100% (try listening and changing via automation)
  Loops (Continued)
  -Starts looking at EQ to isolate certain frequencies/raise volume of certain frequencies
- Wants to take out low frequencies since they will interfere with the kick drum (anything under 200 dB will muddy up the mix)
  --- Turns '1' of EQ Eight to the first option (\_ filter = Allow high frequencies through/Reduce low frequences) and moves it to the right until 200 dB
  --- Repeats for shaker
  Percussion Loop:
  (Drums -> Percussion -> Bongos)
- "I like to use loops when I don't really know what I want, and want to quickly get something on the project"
- Grabs 2 files with Perc_Loop
  --- 1st loop is playing when 2nd one is not - nice call and response
  --- Possibly delete notes if they play at the same time
  --- (1st volume: -7.5, 2nd volume: -20)
- EQ: Put on entire percussion group after consolidating (highlight both)
  --- "There's a lot of low end sub, and it's a little too wide for me"

Note: Now that we have a 4 bar loop, he duplicates it all to be an 8 bar loop

Reverse:
(Drums -> Reverse)

- You can reverse a drum hit/loop in Ableton
- Good for the end of an 8 bar loop, it gets you excited for the next 8 bars
- He adds a reverse clap (Volume = -8)
  --- 4 bars between 88.4.4 and 89.1.1: He occupies the last 3 (Cuts the end of the reverse clap so that we have the beginning of it)
  --- Builds the energy right at the end
  Crash:
  (Drums -> Crash)
- Biscits doesn't use crashes in 'Jungle Sounds', but he uses these claps at the 1.1.1 that act as a crash
- One hit clap from Sounds of Blanc (I picked a short_02 from Noizu)
  --- If we want a Delay effect, use (Audio Effects -> Delay) how to use Delay:
  ----- Currently at 3 (triplet 8th notes) this decides how many times the delay goes back and forth ie. 1 lots of times, 16 doesn't at all
  ----- Ping pong: moves every other delay Left/Right
  ----- Width: the ball in the middle, lowering it makes it less 'panned' and filters the sound to be less bright
  ----- Dry/Wet: how loud this is (0 = short/punchy, 100 = lots of delay)
  ----- Feedback: how long it lasts
  --- Volume: -5.8
  --- "it's not like Biscits invented using a clap with a Delay on it, but we are adding to our arsenal of things to choose from"
  ----- That is what makes a really good producer - done tons of techniques, have a menu in their head
  ----- Learning from other producers and identifying these will help you

Bassline:

- When listening to reference track, you can EQ it (ie. to only lower frequencies) to get ideas
  --- Adds in '8' which blocks off high frequencies, brings it right by the '2'
- Every bar has the same bassline in Biscits: it is important to know how long you want your bassline
  --- If it takes 4 bars, it won't be as repetive
  --- The shorter the phrases ie. 1 bar, it will feel more repitive/hypnotic on the dance floor
  --- Can make interesting/epic stuff with 4 bar phrase, harder to get lost in track
  --- Westend choices a 1-2 bar phrases (just 1 bar OR make 1 bar, make the 2nd a little bit different)

(Bass -> Bass 1)
Using a MIDI Sound:

- Westend does not use Ableton instruments much, prefers 3rd party ie. Serum

Synthesizer:

- Generates the sound from MIDI
- Operator (Instruments -> Operator) for now: [31:00]
  --- Has 4 different oscilators (starts out with only 1, A, being on at -12 dB)
  --- Level: Volume of the Oscilator (Westend puts his at -6.6)
  --- Wave: for tech house, we like a 'subby' base w/o higher frequencies
  ----- Sine wave = pure tone (if you open up an EQ Eight, press M to turn on MIDI keyboard, then hit ASDFGHJK, you see 1 note going up around 300-375)
  ----- Using sine wave may make the track "feel thin in the upper harmonics"
  ----- Saw D wave, you will see a lot of peaks now (these are the harmonics)
  ------- The Saw wave it is double the frequency of the original note
  --- Filter: Turn on '8' in EQ Eight (starts on low-pass filter, ie. lets the lows through)
  --- Freq: Starts at 18.5, the more you bring it down (100-300 is ideal: John Summit used 100 in his video), the higher frequencies get taken away
  ----- That is the sound we are going for in a tech house track (Higher frequencies take away from our drums)
  --- Envelope: Adds plucki-ness to the bass (he puts at 23%, which is only a little, it helps bass movement - John Summit used 50 in his video)
  --- Decay: Put at 245 ms (Starts at 60s, which means the note plays that long)

---

Melody of Bassline:

- Start by highlighting 81-82 and hitting Ctrl-Shift-M (Opens piano roll to write notes)
- Generally, lower the note (ie. C0) will not sound great on speakers because the low sub, most speakers won't even hear it
- F minor is what we will write in
  --- Basslines that start at F0, F#0, G0, G#0 are good (D0, C0, B-1 are too low)
  --- John Summit wrote his in E Minor, with only E and F# (E minor typically is E, F%, G, A, B, C, and D)
- NO right/wrong way to write baselines
  --- Westend draws notes around the thing until he likes something (Here he is doing F0, then G# mostly, ending with a B0)
- Tip for if you can't hear the baseline:
  --- Select everything, Shift-Up
  --- This moves everything up an octave - now I can actually hear the melody
- Moves notes off the grid usually adds flavor
  --- Perfectly on the grid is basic
  --- Select a note and hold Shift
  --- Adjust velocity by holding 'Alt' then up/down
- Now that we have 81-82, Duplicate so that we can make 82-83 a tad different

Sidechain:

- "We are telling the baseline to duck in volume every time the kick hits" ie. every 1/4 beat
  --- Bass from kick + Bass from baseline = Muddy / Distorted (Want to leave space for the kick)
  --- It leads to a pumping sound (boom-ba-doom) helps with the groove
  ----- Kick and bass working together
- Westend usually uses "Kickstart 2 by Nicky Romero" (Volume Sidechain)
  (Notes elsewhere in this document)

Vocals:
(Vocals -> Main/Reverse/Background)

- Important to use more than 1 type of vocal
  --- Use other vocals as effects, pads, 1 shots, etc. (they add complexity and make it more interesting)
- Ideas for vocals: Old hip hop songs, interview on Youtube, Splice, Accapela websites
  (A lot of creativity in tech house comes from your vocals)
  Main:
- Vocal is cool, but it is getting repetitive
  --- Chop it up / switch things up
  --- Reverse a part towards the end of the vocal: Click on snippet so it is in Sample, 'R' on your keyboard
  --- For an 8 bar loop, if we have the same thing for first 3/4ths, we can take the last bar 88-89, take the 2nd half of that, and stretch first half
  ----- Stretch it by multiplying BPM by 2 [52:30]
  ------- Beats: initial
  ------- Tones / Texture: idk but Westend prefers these 2
  ------- Re-Pitch: makes it sound very dark
  ------- Complex / Complex Pro: does same thing, will try and preserve it to make it sounds like original
- Add sidechain to the vocal
  --- I Did 100% Mix to make sure the vocal dips down, Westend didn't use Nicky Romero so idk
- Delay
  --- Change from 'Sync' to 'Time' mode
  --- Bringing the dry/wet up gets this glitchy robot sound
  ----- Something we could automate as we approach a drop/end of bar
  ----- ie. Go from 0 to 100 wet, with a parabolic curve so that right at the very end it goes from 0 to 100 (Right click -> Make sure draw mode is off)

Filling up the track with candy:
(Get as much on the sheet and decide when/where we actually want to use all of it)

Removing low end for 1 bar:
(This gives space for the special vocal from 88-89, it also makes the bass/kick hit harder when it comes in at 89)

- Under reference, make a track lane called 'Low end' and add EQ Eight
- Change to high pass filter (first option = 4x which is a sharper curve vs. gradually removing it) and remove anything below 100-200 hZ
- Automate so that this filter only goes on between 88-89
- Can consider a drum fill for 88-89 too
  --- He looks up snares and puts 6 on in Drums -> Snare [1:00:10]
  ----- Moves them off the grid by way of 'Swing'
  ----- Looks up a swing (1st number: 8/16/32 note, 2nd number: how much swing ie. 05 up to 99)
  ------- Drags it onto the consolidated clip, hits the 'Commit groove' button

Reverse Vocal:

- Go on splice and look up 'Reverse Vocal' for F (CF_VocalFX_Reverse_Tone_F1 from Splice is good)
  --- It is too long, we only want the volume to come in at the end, so make smaller to only hear last 1-2 bars
  --- Grab top left and bring all the way over to top right to help with this

Taking out the kick and bass for the last 4 bars

- He took it out from 93-97

Pads/Atmosphere:
Atmosphere:

- Can be vinyl noise, people talking on the street, etc.
  --- The point is to provide background noise to fill out the track / add character
  _I do not have any atmosphere samples yet_
  Pad:
- The pad usually stays at one note the whole time
- He uses Off World Strings [1:05:30]
  --- He also adds sidechain to it

Lead Synth:

- Can mean a number of things
  --- a synth right before the drop / comes in on the fills
  --- plays over the duration of the drop
- He uses a preset here [1:07:05]
  (Instruments -> Synth Lead)
  --- One idea is to have it go in at the fill from 88-89
  ----- He is writing this starting at F3
  ----- Want to look at Bass 1 and try and keep the notes choice similar
  ----- Automates filter cutoff [1:10:30]

FX:
(Reverse Crash/Crackle/Sidechained)

- Reverse Crash kinda sounds like the 'wooooooosh' sound that I like at the end of phrases
  --- Symbal Crash Reverse Gnirob is solid
  Sidechained:
  Riser 1/2/3:
- Probably don't need them in this drop, but will want them for arrangement
- Have it at 95-97 for now, it kinda works [1:11:00]
  Down 1/2/3:
- For right after the drop ie. 81
- We want something with less of a synth sound [1:11:51]

Misc/Miscellaneous

- For example, a Synth one shot
  --- He takes one part of a Synth loop and puts it at various spots [1:13:13]
  --- I took a Noizu Synth drop stutter in F and made it part of the downlifter
  ----- Added a sidechain, sounded decent

Nicky Romero - Kickstart 2 notes:

- Classic chain is probably used the most (easy/accessible to get sidechain going w/o work)
  --- In creative process you don't want to have to think about technicalities
  Kick View:
- If the kick is going through, it will make it to the far right of Kickstart 2 (if not, the plugin is properly sidechaining the kick)
- You can link the channels to your kickstart plugin
- Mix knob: Chooses the amount of side chain 0-100%
  --- You can hear AND see how the sidechain affects it as you turn the mix up
- Multiband (Band): We don't want to affect the clap since it is part of the groove, only the lower frequencies
  --- Band sidechains anything below it ie. 5.12K hZ will cut out most of the groove/clap, whereas 500 hZ clap is restored and only other percussion is sidechained
  Audio triggering: Great for drum loops and extra kick/bass/drums
- 4 on the flour = hit on 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, etc.
- Select the audio chain of the Kick in top right of Kickstart 2
- In Kickstart 2 next to Sync/Midi, click the new Audio feature (this feature allows you to check that the Kickstart is listening to correct channel)

Installing Kickstart 2 into Windows/Ableton:

- In Ableton, Preferences (Ctrl+,) -> Plugins -> VST3 Plug-In Custom Folder -> Set to 'C:\Program Files\Common Files\VSt3'
- Unpack .zip into Downloads and run the .exe
- Follow the instructions without changing anything, but take note of where you are downloading the .VST3 file
  (Mine went here: "C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3\Kickstart 2.vst3")
- Drag the .

3 file into the Plugins path

- Go back to Preferences -> Plugins, press 'Rescan Plug-Ins'
- Go into Ableton and on the left for 'Plug-Ins' you will see Nicky Romero!

Using Kickstart 2:

- Drag into Channel (rn I am putting it into the Bass 1)
- Under Sidechain, select the Kick channel to hook the plugin to your kick
- Click the wrench/toolbox in the top left to open the Kickstart 2 box on the screen
- Switch from 'Sync' to 'Audio' mode to help with anything that is not the 4 on the floor kicks
- To ensure it does its job, use the Classic Chain and put the mix at close to 100%
- Turn on Band Mode around 500 hZ to make sure the claps and percussions are not being affected
  Tip: Press the headphones to sample the ducked bass [3:45]
  More tips for creative tricks: Synths, other sounds [4:45]

John Summit - How to make Rolling Basslines
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT5ptnp1K7E)

Part 1: Bass:
Operator (Instruments -> Operator) [0:19]

- Saw wave (SwD)
- Fixed Level: -12 dB
- Decay: 600 ms
- Release: 146ms
- Sustain: 0.0 dB
- Vel: 0%

---

- Filter: Freq = 300 Hz, Res = 30%, Change setting from 'Clean' to 'OSR'
- Bottom: Time 0%, Tone 70%, Volume: 0 dB

Limiter

- 3ms Lookahead

EQ Eight [0:25]
1st - Remove Unwanted High Ends

- Turn everything off besides '8', which will be the sharp curve with a 4
- Freq = 144 Hz, Q = 0.66
- Put the '8' in the middle of the box between 100-200, keeping the initial line horizontal

2nd - Remove Unwanted Low Ends

- Keep 1,2,3,4 and turn '1' into the sharp curve with a 4
- Freq = 30.0 Hz, Q = 0.71
- Put the '8' in the middle of the box between 100-200, keeping the initial line horizontal

KickStart 2

- I cannot see his parameters, so will use classic

Auto Filter (Audio Effects -> Auto Filter)

- Curve: 2nd option (starts bottom left and ends top right)
- Filter: Freq = 26.0 Hz, Res = 14%

Base Mono (Audio Effects -> Utility)

- Turn on 'Bass Mono'

Part 2: Bass MIDI:
2 notes: F# and F (Starts at F#, goes down to F, then back up) [0:40]
Pitch bend is to give the track a 'rolling' feeling, as without it it's super boring

1. Highlight bars 1-5 on new MIDI channel, Ctrl-Shift-M

- Go to Clip -> Envelopes and turn the settings to MIDI Ctrl / Pitch Bend
- He adds about 2000 between 1.1.3 and 1.2
  --- Shape: triangle that rolls off parabolic [1:15]
  --- Duplicate so there's another from 1.3.3 to 1.4
- You should now hear upward movement in the bassline

Heider - Tech House Bass Line Styles

How to get bass line into MIDI (by cutting up the bass line)

- Went in and chopped up the whole segment
- Everytime he saw a hit in the wave form, he figured out if it was kick/bass/clap
- Keep the bass line hits only and Ctrl-J to consolidate
- Highlight and drag into an empty MIDI channel

RBass: Creates more harmonics to the frequency you choose
Voxengo SPAN: Used to see what note/content the original bass line is
SubBoomBass:
Heavy:
RaveGenerator:

Sonny Fodera x Biscits: 1 note bass line [15:20]

- What takes it to the next level: a square/stub knock sound that plays every
  --- Without this, the rolling bass line itself would be boring

Recap:

- Always layer your bass lines
- 2 important things in a bass line

1. Direction (is it going to be 1 note and thumping away? or a melody with a direction)
2. Rhythm (the groove. don't have your notes on the grid, use swing!)

- To create interesting patterns, alternate the \_
- Create call + response

Odd Mob - Left To Right Track Breakdown

- Track started as a joke, ended up in Beatport top 5

1. Buildup

Kick

- A few layers (Note: he is writing his kicks in MIDI)
- Main kick: Graves kick, volume = 0
  --- Messed around with the attack to make it less clicky
  --- FabFilter Pro-L 2 used to catch the top of the transient (look into this plugin)
  --- Kick is pushed very hard (so were other elements of the track - he wanted it to sound very clippy/distorted)
  ----- before mixing there was lots of clipping - use at your own caution!
- 2nd layer: High pass layer, volume = -2.5
  --- Sounds super clicky [2:50]
  --- High passed for the purpose of NOT wanting two sources of sub information (used x4 at 141 Hz, '1' is to the bottom-left of the '2')
  --- Note: He loves to 'tweak his EQ's to high heaven', meaning he will add separate limiters and EQ's
  --- Kick tweak: $10 plugin that Chris Lake uses: has a bunch of great presets (Here, it tightens the kick by shortening the transient)
  --- More limiters
- 3rd 'layer': Techno sub, volume = -5.3
  (12_HT_Drum_Loop_Kick_128 from Splice)
- He removes quite a bit of the sub from the kick group as a whole, because of this sub's existence [5:56]
- With this sample:
  --- Pitches it down 3 semitones to match key
  --- Multiband 2 band used to break track into everything < 100 Hz, everything > 100 Hz
  --- Small amount of saturation [7:00] (personal choice thing - it 'adds warmth')
  --- Volume Shaper 4: [7:55]
  Note: He likes to produce with a limiter on master, and his kick at 0 (everything is very loud)

Hat Loop

- Was looking very a shaker-y vibe
  --- Looks that are across a span of time are better
  ----- One shot single shaker can sound 'MIDI/clinical' in his opinion [9:35]
  --- Clip on complex pro/no groove: straightforward
  --- Clip on Beats w/ groove: Makes it 'stabbier' by setting 'Preserve' to 1/16th notes with arrow to right, 40 (track is very swingy)
  ----- He then matches to the groove of the track via committing Ableton's built in groove Notator 16C Swing (uses this groove for whole track)
- EQ Eight: '2' is removing everything below 1K [10:14]

Main Tom
(adl_tr120_arguingtom)

- Very loud
- Toms get tricky because you don't always want to remove all of the bass, since half of the character of tom sample is the bass, but it clashes with bassline
- Drags into Simpler (classic mode): Decay=414ms, Sustain=-Inf, Release=50ms, Volume=-12dB
- Controls: pitches down 8 semi tones (Transp = -8)
  --- then writes the notes in MIDI
- iZotope Trash 2 (industry staple): overdrive, multiband distortion, [13:55]
  --- adds a lot of high end grit
- Limiter: pushing it quite hard
- EQ Eight: removes sub + everything below 91ish with '1' at x4
- Ozone: 'imager' mode [16:36]
  --- he notes here that Trash 2 from above is introducing stereo into the sample [16:57], and imager draws this back

Clap:

- almost like a snare
  --- he 'wanted a clap' but 'also didn't' since he did not want that long transient sound [17:50]
- he writes notes in MIDI
  --- 2 layers:
  --- body of clap: saturated 909 pitched down 7 semitones
  --- top end crispiness: pitched up 4 semitones
  ----- Brought the decay down on both claps to make them 'stab' instead of lasting longer like a normal clap does
- The grouped clap goes through the following:
  --- limiter (ceiling = -0.30 dB) he says 'this probably should have been Pro L but I was lazy'
  --- camel crusher: a distortion plugin with presets, british clean is a very subtle one (makes it louder, but doesn't do much) [19:55]
  --- EQ Eight: '2' is way up high in the mids at 1k (this turns it from a clap into a knock)
  ----- Could have found a good knock sample instead of doing everything above for the clap, ha
- Auto filter: soft low passing - freq=5.35 kHz
- Kick tweak: Shapes the sound quite a lot [21:30]

Takeaways:

- Use Limiters (ie. FabFilter Pro) to 'push' sounds, I need to learn more about this because I thought limiter's just nullified volume

Zookeeper - Better Piano Chords with 'Cthulhu'

1. Drags in Vocal

- It is 4 bars, duplicates it to have 8

2. Bring in a clap

- Basic clap going off at 1.3

3. Draws a beat using his MIDI keyboard [5:30]

4. Make a new Channel and pull up Cthulhu

- Cthulhu: MIDI instrument where you can make a new instrument channel (Could be Serum) you use Cthulhu to play the instrument channel
- Go to instrument channel, set the MIDI input to Cthulhu

## Muss - How to Groove like a Pro

1. Find a top loop that you really really like

- Not necessarily a sample, but a groove/swing (I used Noizu_125_hihat_house_01)
  --- Look for things to be off the grid, as well as "velocity changes"
  --- Consolidate before moving on

2. Create a reference MIDI Channel for the groove

- Right click on groove -> Extract Groove
  --- Takes the transients, and puts it into MIDI data. It also puts it into the groove pool on the left
  --- Groove pool: Set of parameters that tells MIDI/Audio to shift/move/change velocity
- Drag the new item in the groove pool into an empty MIDI Channel
  --- The notes are all 1/16th's right now - Select All -> Extend them out (helps you see them better)
- Move the notes to C3 (it is on C1 rn) Select All -> Shift-Up (2x)
- Add Simpler and EQ Eight
  --- Put a Closed hat into the Simpler if you want to hear the MIDI beat

3. Remember the Theory behind this:

- We have our groove (The top loop)
- We have our bass of what we want our groove to be (The MIDI)
- Anytime we bring a new element into this track, we need those elements to fall in line with the groove that we have established
  --- If we don't, things will sound off

4. Applying groove to any loop

- First, ensure it is on the grid
  --- Ctrl-A to Select All, Ctrl-I to apply warp markers, Ctrl-U to Quantize onto the grid
  ----- Note: Warp markers also allows you to move each transient exactly how you'd like to
- Using the Groove/Swing that we put into a MIDI clip, add to the clip and Commit

Alternative way to apply groove to a loop (Muus prefers this way)

- Quantize (Same as above)
- Zoom in and move the transients in the loop by hand
  --- Sliding the golden warp marker allows you to move them easily
  --- Remember to use the MIDI track as reference

Takeaways:

- Easy to tell if you are just stacking on top loops on w/o a real purpose
- If you are using sample packs and top loops, we need to analyze them and figure out how they work
  --- If they don't work, use warp markers + the grid to line them up with our track
  --- Will improve the call + response, as well as make the track feel more organic and less robotic
- Ignoring these steps is not going to stick out like a sore thumb, but things will feel off
  --- If your track feels off, it may have to do with your groove being off!

Zen World - 5 Tech House Basses that are Useful
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dicR_0HZacY

Bass 1: The Sustain: Fisher/Mark Knight

- Multiple variation of this
- Standard bass: Square + Saw combination (OSC A = Square/WT POS 4, OSC B = Saw/click pencil -> Add/Remove -> Init All (Default), go up 1 octave at -2)
  --- Filter = ON: Low pass filter, Turn cutoff knob to 110-148 Hz [1:40] (this removes a lot of the frequencies we don't need - determines how the bass sounds)
- Note: Adding saw wave gives us a higher version of the D (it fills out the top end) and the mid-low frequencies that we NEED in the low keys
- RAND: Put at 0% (For OSC A + B)
  --- Tells Serum we are not fucking around (We want to stay at phase the whole time)
  --- Will come in clutch with Bass's that are constantly hitting/moving around fast
- Tape saturation
  --- FX -> Turn on Distortion
  ----- Change 'Tube' to 'Tape Sat.' -> Move Post Frequency up to 193 (this vamps it up a little bit more), Q = 0.4
  --- FX -> Turn on Compressor
  ----- Attack and release really don't matter, but set at 54-55
  --- FX -> EQ
  ----- Boost mid lows with 2nd option on left (changing from top left to middle left)
  ----- Gain to 4.6, Q to 46%, Freq to 114
- Note: He is always running Voxengo SPAN to ensure that there is mid low (around 100-200) (this is why the bass in his packs sound so good always)
  --- Go to [5:55] this sounds very good
  --- Another variation: Start copying what he does at [6:10] I really like this one

Bass 2: The Resonator: Martin Ikin/Chris Lake

- Less house, more garage-y [7:25]
  Way 1:
- OSC A: Default -> Analog -> Basic Shapes -> Square Wave (Put WT POS at 12-12:30)
- Filter On: MG Low 12-18-24 (depends on how strict slope is)
  --- Change cutoff to 10:45
- Envelope 2 on: Sustain = -Inf dB, then drag onto the Cutoff from the Filter we turned on
  --- Then switch Fil cutoff to all the way down (8 Hz), and Env 2 cutoff (the new blue knob) to 63-67
  --- Res: 37
  --- Back down by Env 2 setting: Sustain = 0%, Decay = 473ms
- OSC B: turn on both its section and the box in 'Filter'
  --- Fil Drive: 13%
  --- If you want it wide, change from 1 to 4 in the 'Unison' by Detune in OSC B, also change Detune to 0.13
- I like this bass quite a bit here: [8:38]
- FX -> EQ:
  --- Turn on low pass filter ie. 3rd option on bottom left, Q = 45%,
  --- In Env 2 Parameters, add 'A Bit' of attack up to 39ms (this gives it a fresh vibe)
- Look at more possibilities from [9:11] to [9:59] (I kinda like the one around 9:38)
- Recommendation: Use the Resonator with a Sub, if possible (this is because you lose a lot of low-end)
- Make sure OSC A is at Octave -3 and OSC B at -2

Bass 3: 808 Tom Bass and Long 808: Walker and Royce, Chris Lake

- Default -> Analog -> Analog_BD_Sin (sine wave-wave table)
- Env 3: Sustain = 0 dB, Decay = 99ms,
  --- Drag Env3 onto the 'CRS' Under Analog_BD_Sin
  --- Alt-Shift-Click
  --- Lower octave to -3
  --- 'Click' tone is controlled by where you put the white slider bar by CRS, as well as the Decay
  ----- This sound is more of a thump (when he says this Decay is 68ms, slide by CRS, ENV3->CoarsePit = 19)
  From here there are multiple avenues...
  1: More mellow
- Turn Mono/Legato on in Voicing (bottom right)
- Sustain down to -6.8, Decay up to 1.89s, Release to 1.24s
- Can make it more aggressive with FX -> Distortion -> Drive knob all the way up [12:50]
  2: Something with less release
- Sustain down to -Inf, Decay to 441ms, Release to 417ms
  --- Drive knob to 58% (if you want more of a \_, go to 80%)
  3: More of a click w/ 1 shot mode
- OSC -> Noise ON -> Change 'AC_hum1' to 'GlassLid 1'
- Noise level to 51%, or 77%
- Check box for 1 shot mode (it is the thing to the left of the Phase knob)
- Pitch to 43%
  4: Adding onto 3, making it 'fit a litle more'
- Filter ON, Boxes checked for A/B/N/S
- Cutoff to 48 Hz
- Slide env 1 onto Filter, Env1 -> Fil Cutoff: 59
- Filter: MG Low 24
- Possibly change noise level to 55% under GlassLid 2

Bass 4: FM Basslines: Oldschool Shiba San

- More garage / deep house vibe
  [14:10] - [18:23]

Bass 5: Saw Bass / Modern Wide Saw Bass

- Can be used as a nice additive bass
  --- Note: If you have sustain or punchy bass down the center, adding this saw bass on top can add spice to the track
- OSC A: Rand = 0 (turned all the way left),
- OSC B:
- Filter: Turn on w/ MG Low 18, A turned on,
- Envelope 2: Sustain = 0%, Drag onto Filter -> Cutoff, Turn fil cutoff to 11 Hz, Turn Env 2 -> Fil Cutoff to 71 Hz
  --- Back to Env 2: Decay 767 ms
- Note: Hard thing about the Saw is how much of the uppers of the Saw do you want in the song
  --- How do we get it to sound good AND clean? [19:15]
- FX -> Distortion -> Dist_Drv = 71-86% (he settled at 86%), 'Tube' to 'Tape Sat.'
  --- Get rid of top end by moving the circle to F=1912, Q=0.1 (in Post)
- FX -> Compressor -> Multiband ON -> Thresh = -11.1 dB
- FX -> Filter -> MG Low 18, Cutoff = 75 Hz, Drag Env2 onto Cutoff, change Env2->FX Fil Freq to 58, FX Fil Freq = 21
  --- FX Fil Drive = 19%
- FX -> EQ -> Right side, pick 2nd option (right-middle), Gain = 4.2, Q = 39%, EQ Freq = 191 Hz
- Voicing (bottom right) -> Turn on Mono + Legato
- Back to Filter: Can add Res to 30% for diff sound (more acid-y vibe)

This is what he really likes to do
(It creates a heavily layered bass)

- Menu -> Init preset
- Turn on Sub, Octave = 0, Sub Osc Level = 69, Use Sine wave (if we aren't going to go too low)
- OSC A: Unison 4, Detune: 0.12,
- Filter: A and B on, Normal -> High 12 (settles on 24, this is a high pass), Fil Cutoff = 213 Hz, Res = 0%, Drive = 8%
- OSC B: Unison 4
- FX -> Filter -> MG Low 18, Cutoff = 8-14 Hz,
- Env 2 On, Sustain = 0%, Drag Env2 onto Cutoff right by MG Low 18, set Env2-FX fil freq = 62 (then does 89), Drive = 18
- In Env 2 paramters: Decay = 575 ms
  --- From here, just find what you want
- This is where Voxengo SPAN plays a huge role!
  --- [22:23] Look how the subs get up higher, but the rest is lower
  --- Moving high pass more to the left (Filter -> Fil Cutoff = 65 Hz now)

Takeaways:

- These are the main / staples in tech house today
- It is up to you what you like
- If you want it to sound unique, layer basses on top

Muus - How to use Reference Tracks

1. Find a track that fits the same energy ie. percussive bass line vs. rolling bass line
2. Try not to add a reference track into your song too soon

- Let the groove take you up until a finished demo (with automation and actual identity) before picking a reference track
- Picked reference track since both had percussive bass as well as hi hats with similar energy

3. Setup for the reference track

- Create audio track, Change 'Master' to 'Ext. Out' (this track has already been mastered)

4. Remove any space at beginning that would have the track not on the grid
5. If you bring in a track that is not the same BPM, you have to warp it

- Double click into the audio
  --- Make sure you are in complex mode
- Click Warp -> Set the BPM
  --- The downbeat should now be perfect on grid

Note: His mastering chain:

- Utility
- Utility
- Limiter
- SSLComp Stereo
- FabFilter Saturn
- Ozone 9 Imager
- FabFilter Pro-Q 3
- EQ Eight
- Voxengo SPAN
- Youlean Loudness Meter 2
- Voxengo MSED

Westend - How to make easy tech house buildups with 'INFINITE'
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK932qRtdp8

- Infinite is from Toolroom, Mark Knight's label
  --- He is a master of tension
- This plugin helps you create tension in your tracks
  --- Building energy up and releasing it is #1 in dance music

3 different ways to use infinite in your productions

1. Buildups

- Macro automations to create tension when there is not some originally
  --- ie. w/ a loop

2. Sound Design (fills)

- natural fills with the elements that you already have

3. Mixing

- Using infinite on a bus or return channel to give a sound more presence in a mix, especially a dry mix

Starting out...

- Very simple plugin with 1 knob (similar to endless smile - INFINITE has more presets though)
  --- Dry/Wet knob with presets
- Really great plugin for tech house if you want to add more energy to your buildups
  --- Definitely add to drum group
  ----- You can even add it to individual sounds ie. clap / open high hat / percussion
- Presets:
- Risers: Great for buildups
- Downers: Low pass filter where you lose frequencies
- Great for providing these gaps ie. 1 bar before drop where a vocal kicks back in
  --- Building up the drums and having a reverb tail for the 1 bar of vocals is a very good technique (make sure to bring One Knob hard down at 1)

1. Buildups

Drums:

- Throughout the build up, the dry/wet is being automated up parabolically (Automation lane = One Knob) [4:10]
  --- Reverb, Delay, White Noise are being added (Westend was using the preset Risers -> Stratospheric) [6:20]

Vocal Loop/Riser via Serum

- These are both grouped together, with Infinite slapped onto the group
  Notes on the Vocal:
- Vocal loop comes from toolroom academy
  Notes on the Serum:
- Filter -> Cutoff is automated down [7:39]
- Auto Filter (Low pass filter) is automated to allow the noise to progressively get louder w/ more frequencies
  Notes on the group:
- Infinite -> Complex Transitions -> Cape Town
- Supposed to create a building effect towards the end of these 2 sounds / an atmosphere that lasts into the drop
  --- We don't want it to sound so sudden when we lose these sounds at the end of the build-up
- Automation goes from No Dry/Wet to 52 from 31-drop at 33, then 33-35 takes away half, from 35-41 it slows goes away linearly
- He ends up playing around with having more reverb ie. Going 0-100-100-down OR 0-64-100-down [9:35]
  --- This allows you to get risers/downlifters that emanate from your samples AND replaces going into Splice and going to get downlifters
  --- Westend prefers the natural effects / reverb tails from your build elements, anyways
-

More capabilities of the plugin

- If you open it up and hit 'Complex' mode, you can see the effects that went into making that preset
  --- Delay, Crunch (saturation - 3 types of distortions available), Reverb, LFO (and the rate)
- Making your own preset in Infinite is a great way of 'making your own sound' as a producer

2. Sound Design

- Westend used it on one of the percussion sounds (cowbell/clave sound)
- Every 8 bars he likes to do a fill ie. take out the kick/bass and add something else in
  --- Can use infinite here
  --- Drum fill or synth sound can be this fill too, but it is nice to have it come from an existing element
  How he used it (between bars 40-41):
- Infinite came on sharply
- One Knob was automated parabolically
- Preset used: Riser -> Up Up and Away
- Note: Look into the sound shaping

3. Mixing tool

- He doesn't think the plugin was intended for this, but it still sounds really cool
  Steps:
- Insert a return track (his current mixing chain is small verb -> infinite -> big verb -> delay -> ny compress, fyi)
- Set up (he used the Drums group) to send -30 to -35 dB
- It's a super long reverb / delayed sound (solo the return track to listen) (He uses the Stratospheric preset)
  --- Can really help fill out a drum mix
  --- If you don't want to do the whole drum group, put it on an individual clap for example
  ----- It creates an atmosphere of a big hall

Zen World - 3 Simple Steps for Fat Drums
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/4UAIWQA1YtQ

1. Good Samples

- Make sure they fit your track
- Buying Deceiver 5 by Zen World is fire

2. Saturation

- Buying Decapitator from soundtoys
  --- Volume will stay the same in Ableton, sound will be louder and fatter to your ears
- Also trying BB Tubes from Waves

3. Parallel Compression

- Utilize your favorite compressor on a return track
- Send your drums to that return track
- Make sure to push the drums hard
- If you want:
  --- Filter out the low end with a high pass filter
  --- Level the compress signal

---

Zen World - Hat Techniques Every Music Producer Should Know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIn4sesC78U&t=18s

1. Vocoder

- Usually used on voice
- Can be used on your closed/open hats
- Noise controller on left side moves x/y
- Release changes how long it takes
- You can draw in the frequencies you want to hit
- Put at 50% to do parallel

2. Redux

- Lower Rate, Bits
  --- Need to EQ out low ends (he puts the '2' right under '3' with a regular high pass)

3. Autopan

- Using an LFO for the lazy person and putting it on the Pan and moving the close hats left/right
- Audio Effects -> Autopan
  --- Check Box for LFO, Sine wave (1st option), Pan = 78 would be heavy, turn of R at top (so we don't keep resetting), adjust Hz to slow down/make fast
  --- This is the cleanest form to get Closed Hats to be Wide
  ----- Hates people who use the \_ because they are GMO producers [2:52]
  --- Another method would be switching sine wave for the one that looks like city buildings, notes to 1/6, put R button on, Pan = 50

4. Respect the Open Hat

- If open/close hit at same time, we don't want this
- Open hat is hitting on 1.1.3, 1.2.3, etc.
- Can make a groove with closed hats around it ie. 1/16th notes in the following way:
  --- "-C3--C3C3-C3-C3-----C3" [4:43]
- Black V Neck: Open hat is the baby and driving force of a track, try not to put much stuff in front of it
  --- Process the open hat as good as you can, then respect the space it has acquired

5. Attack

- super cool for chill stuff
  --- if you have heard the open hat/closed hat sound like a shaker, it could have just been attack added
- Use a MIDI with Simpler on it and add attack, maybe even lower decay (He has attack 37ms, decay 94-134 ms)
- This is a way to add swing to a track

6. Swing is King

- if you are making house music, you need swing
- We want velocity changes and to take things off of the grid [7:04]
  in groove pool:
- Quantize: quantizes the loop before getting swing (0)
- Timing: determines amount of swing added (95)
- Random: adds random timing based on groove (0)
- Velocity: how much the groove affects the velocity/volume on sample (100)

7. Velocity on Hats

- Hats volume going CH-ch-CH-ch (up, down, up, down)
- Make sure to do this with open hat:
  --- Open MIDI and throw on a Simpler, Drag an open hat into Simpler
  --- Controls -> Turn on LFO, Changes from Hz to Notes 3/8, Vol = 45
  --- Highlight 4 bars of MIDI, Ctrl-Shift-M, Notes are 1/16th notes at 1.1.3, 1.2.3, 1.3.3, 1.4.3
  ----- Can also do this by turning off LFO in Simpler and messing with Velocity in the MIDI [8:50]

8. Progress your hats

- Very important
- When you have an open hat, you might automate the decay up every 4 bars
- If you study a lot of your fav artists tracks, they are doing this
- Rides vs. Released open hats

Zen World - Kick Techniques Every Music Producer Should Know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnNUqi9AFQQ

1. The sample matters

- will need more than sausage fattener to fix a bad sample

2. Layer your kicks properly

- Keep it simple (don't just put down as many as possible - 3 is the max)
- Arrangement: In MIDI, with 1/16th notes, set a C3 at 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
  Main layer:
  (The one you think sounds good, this is the body)
- Open MIDI Track -> Add Simpler, Drag kick into Simpler -> Take only the first 0:00:022
- EQ out the highs: '8' as a regular low pass filter to the bottom left of '3' (around Freq = 550, Q = 0.82)
- Add Audio Effects -> Utility,
- Black Box Analog Design HS-2 (Saturation - ignore for now)

Transient layer:
(Gives the kick its identity)

- Open MIDI Track -> Add Simpler, Drag kick into Simpler -> Transient will usually be the first milliseconds of the Kick (you don't need the tail when layering) [1:55]
- We already have the body, so EQ out the lows: '2' as a high pass filter (around Freq = 240, Q = 0.75)

Unique-ness layer:

- he didn't talk about it much (says its up to you)

3. Anchoring the kick

- This is the first thing he teaches new students
- Note: Send output of your kick and all drums to a 'Drums' group, which then should output to master
- Do this with Audio Effect -> Utility (I set mine to -3.29 dB, and the kick/drum channels both hit exactly -6 dB)
  Why we want the peak hitting at -6 dB
- The mix will revolve around -6 dB (on average) so that way we have headroom for mastering [4:30]
- If kick is landing -6, bass should land between -12 and -6 (depending on the track)

4. Notchz Monster (400-500 Hz)

- The reason we go a notch down in this area is this is the area you get the 'cardboard box' effect from Kick drums
  --- Too much of this 'd-d-d' will cloud the track up
- EQ Eight: Change '2' and '8' so they are on the ends, put '3' at Freq = 550, Gain = -4.25, Q = 0.96
- He says don't do this on every kick

5. Progress your kick drum

- Progressing things in your track makes it a lot more enjoyable to the listener
- Don't show all of your cards in the intro of the song
- We want to create a moment ie. Bar 9 or 17 where the Low end comes in
- EQ Eight on Kick group with '1' as a x4 at Freq = 120, Gain = 0, Q = 0.66
  --- Automate so that during Intro/Breakdowns/Dull moments, this EQ is turned on and the kick is less in the mix
- Producers used to get rid of the kick, now a lot just remove the low end
- Another idea: Remove one part of the kick ie. transient during certain parts of track ie. Intro
  --- Chorus it can have an extra layer, to bring more energy

6. Processing - Keep it Simple, Stupid

- Saturation, EQ, Compression (don't do anything crazy or drastic)
- We want to do slight things that bring it out more
- EQ on the Kick for the 400-500 Hz
- Saturation added [9:37]

Ending thougths:

- Go to Session View and check that your Kick is sending to the drums at -6 dB

Zen World - How To Glue Your Kick and Tech House Bass Together
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsxJcDo2lVc
(Using multi-band compression)

A lot of kicks in tech house are 909s, sometimes super saturated

What is the purpose of the sidechain:

- Students: to make it go pump
- Zen World: To remove the bass out of the way for the kick
  --- Need to ensure that our sidechain is proper

Note: He is using Serum for his bass

- He then adds a weird EQ [2:53] and then Sidechain to the Serum/Bass

Note: Look into technique he used to get the exact waveform needed for the sidechain!

Glue them together using Fabfilter Pro MB:

- Split into 3 bands: Sub, Thump, High End
  --- He put this on the Kick+Bass group, but you could also do on the entire drums bus

Using 'Glue Compressor' in Ableton:

- Fabfilter allows you to EQ while doing it since you can scope the sounds, otherwise Glue Compressor does it all
- Attack = 3, Release = 0.6, Ratio = 4, Range = 70.0 dB, Dry/Wet = 100, Threshold = -12.4 dB, Makeup = 1.27 dB
  --- Definitely play around with this  
  --- He played around by putting attack all the way down, Release up, Ratio = 2, Makeup = 5.4

Zen World - INSANE Drum Loop Trick The Pros Don't Want You To Know
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3RU-zF6W74

Example A:

- All drum loops quantized
- Swing applied (based on the bass line of the track) so that everything has the same swing/groove

Example B:

- All over the place
- Issues arise when using loops with different swings

1. Set up Kick
2. Get a groovy bass w/ swing, Consolidate and Extract Groove
3. Bring in drum loops (Make sure to be on Beats -> Transient instead of Complex)

- Just like Muus did in his video, I went through by hand to make sure things are exactly on groove
  Note: If you get anything from this video, it is that different drums have different grooves
- Another way: Quantive everything (Highlight Clip in bottom -> Ctrl-U, Then apply groove)

EDM Tips - 14 Mixing Tips I Wish I Knew When I Started
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buBH3aPBQ5k&list=WL&index=18

1. Good headphones / speakers
2. Reference tracks
3. Mono switch

- Balancing the levels in Mono lets you focus on the relative levels
- Also helpful for EQ'ing, seeing which frequencies are frequencies
- If your mix sounds good in mono, it will sound good in stereo

4. Top-down mixing approach
5. Anchoring the kick

- Setting it to peak around -6 to -12 dB

6. High pass filter on everything besides Kick/Bass
7. Separate your sub from your bass

- If your mix is not working in the low end, do this

8. Kick & Bass grouped together

- Quality in low end increases with compression/saturation

9. Using Aux channels for reverb/delay

- This lets you reverb only the mid/highs that you want [14:41]

10. Sidechain compression

- More than just for the kick
- Have reverb/other things duck below the vocal so the vocal cuts through the mix

11. Room reverb on Auxiliary channel

- Gels everything together [18:30]

12. Saturation

- Especially on groupings ie. drums group
- Makes the drums pop out in the mix
- Don't overdo it!

13. Check the mix on multiple systems

- Studio monitors, airpods, laptop speakers
- MixChecker Pro

14. Mix for other People

EDM Tips - 8 Reasons Your Mixes Sound Thin and Muddy (and How to Fix Them)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKh5rdIt6ZY

1. Sound selection
2. Composition (basically the same thing)
3. Phase cancellation (Phasing, especially in the bass - Break your bass apart into bass/sub)
4. Frequency masking (Have the vocal cut through the mix with:

- EQ to duck piano where vocal freqs are and/or Sidechain the piano to duck below vocal)

5. Mono switch

- Put Utility on Master
- Create a mono switch on the master channel (Ctrl-K, click on 'Mono', click 'm', Ctrl-K)
- Produce in Mono to make sure Stereo is not fooling you

6. Low cut everything in your track besides kick/bass

- Mud resides in the Hz range of 100-125

7. Auxiliary Channels (for spatial effects)

- To clear up mud in your mix ie. we only want the high frequencies from a reverb [13:00]
- Auxiliary channel for Reverb (basically, it looks like there is an FX channel that the reverb is on, instead of the vocals thing)

8. Top down mixing

- Start with kick (anchor)
- If you can get kick/bass/hats/leads/vocals sounding good, in mono, everything else just has to work around it

Get This Party Started Track Breakdown - Westend
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/kick-and-bass-mixing-heider/lectures/43504324

Vocal:

- plugin = Gem Dopamine
- EQ'ing out the lows (Freq = 70)
- Parallel processing to make the vocal bigger/wider
  --- Uses this rack on synths/vocals to make them fat
- Auto Filter (Low pass filter) that automatically opens up as the vocal comes in

Lead Synth

- Used a sound in the drop as an FX buildup sound
  --- Songs gets a lot tighter, more continuity between buildup + drop
- Future_Rave_For_Serum -> LD 11 (big room progressive-y sound, from soundfactorystory)
- Using 'Rate' to keep synth sound locked in with the kick [2:30]
- Utility: Automate the volume to be louder in the drop

Bass

- Dragged vocal into an empty MIDI -> Convert to Harmony
  --- He did this to get the notes, and then make a bass line off of that
- Saturator: Makes the bass louder / have more drive
- EQ Eight: Takes away all of the high frequencies + the sub [5:00]
  --- Too much high end makes it sound bad with the vocal
- Compressor:
- Kickstart w/ Classic Chain + Mix 100%

Bass 2

- He replicates the bass to help add more bite / make it easier to hear

Bootleg Edits - Westend
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/bootleg-edits-westend/lectures/43757997

Intro

- We usually do not have stems (this lowers the quality)
- Start by getting everything that you want (Original song, Acapella, moises.ai stems)
  --- He shows how the frequencies > 10,000 are gone, can try to fix this with original track
- Warp the audio files (beatport tells you BPM and Key)
  --- Mixed in Key app to verify BPM, to also find the minor key (he says dance music sounds better in Minor keys)

How to Warp the Song
Example: Brought HYFR (BPM: 98) into Ableton and it was slow w/ 145 BPM on clip, yet in Rekordbox and Beatport it is 98

1. Change the following in Preferences -> Record/Warp/Launch

- Loop/Warp Short Samples: Auto
- Auto-Warp Long Samples: Off
- Default Warp Mode: Beats
- Create Fades on Clip Edges: On

2. Drag in the song

- I dragged in 'Umbrella' and see that it has a BPM of 120
- Turn Warp On/Off/On, then change BPM to proper # (Umbrella is 87 in Rekordbox)

3. Make sure the Drum/1st Transient is hitting at 1.1.1

- For Umbrella, there was some white noise
- Go into clip, move the flag on the left until the 1st hit
  --- Then go and make sure the drums are hitting at 1,2,3,etc.

4. Change BPM to 123

- I chose 123 because it is slower than 126/128 so helps the rap lyrics sound less sped-up

Drums

1. Kick

- He is finding what notes are in C# minor via Ctrl-Shift-M then Turning on Scale
- C# is low on the sub for a kick, F# or G#
  --- He grabs a kick in G#, shapes it so that it is shorter
  --- Then layers kick with another kick (takes out low end from Kick #2)

2. Clap

- He is looking for something short and snappy (recommends the pack: tech house market, in good-deals)
- Adds 2 layers: for 1st, makes it shorter, for 2nd, removes lows/mids

3. Drums loops

- Does trick where he has Clip on Beats/Transients/1st arrow choice/bring number down from 100
  --- After consolidating, the BPM changes to 128
- Note: He is trying to get to the samples of the bootleg, so getting a quick groove with drum loops
- Puts EQ on low ends, x under 350

4. Main hat

- Adds 2 Open hi hats

5. Shaker loop

- Puts EQ on low ends, x4 under 562

(At this point, we have 32 bars for intro, 8 bars after)

Using the Vocal for Texture

- He takes an interesting vocal (the rah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh from Jay-Z) and brings it into vocals section
  --- Make sure it is on the beat
- Adds Echoboy (great delay plugin from Soundtoys) with the Rhythmic / Military Split preset, turns down dry/wet
  --- This is helping add width, use Mix and Feedback to control the delay
- Adds Auto filter on to start (I like this a lot - Automate from down to full from Bar 1-17)
  --- Could automate to open this up as we go throughout the intro
- Adds sidechain
- EQs out the lows with an x/300

Making the Bassline

- He doesn't know what bass line to use, first thought is something acid-y with Sting64
  --- Takes Diva preset and then uses Sting64 (I would probably use Serum presets instead)

Tying It All Together

- Adds the Vocal to come in 33-41, loops it 41-49
- Starts adding the Synth into Misc at Bar 17 (EQ out low end, possibly Auto Filter too)
- Uses Voxengo MSED to make sure the misc/synth is not too wide in the mix
- He doesn't like the acid MIDI from Sting so he drags a Synth into the MIDI Channel -> Converts to Melody
  --- This continues much longer trying to find a good C# MIDI [3:00-8:10]
- Takes away the drums from 33-41 and allows the normal beat to play
- 41-49 the drums come back in as well as a snare roll w/ Endless Smile
- Downlifter (noise fall from Splice - noizu has these) from 33-35 to add fx
- Reverse crash at 40-41 when drums come back in (add Delay)

Most Overlooked Ways To Finish Music Faster
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvPXRg4SqA

1. Set deadlines

- This can be a lot of pressure, but you won't get stuck in 8 bar loop mode (or try to be perfectionist)

2. Separate the music production process

- One thing he always does wrong is jumping all over the place
- Remedy: Schedule sessions for mixing/sound design/songwriting/mastering
- Nothing wrong with mixing as you go, finish the idea

3. Make a template
4. Learn your DAW

- Most important thing for beginners
  Examples:
  Ctrl-I to insert time
  Locking/unlocking automations so you can copy/paste stuff
  Ctrl-Shift-X to delete a section
  Organizing things in color

5. Study other artist music

- If you can mimick your favorite producer to a certain extent, you can learn how to arrange a track
- Limit yourself to the genre that you want to make

Zen World - How To Transition In Your Music Without FX
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbs8_8ZJJOM

- White noise effects are the usual ie. uplifters/downlifters that make no sense

1. Transitional cues

- Melody/sound/opneing the cutoff/something to alert the listener of the change
- End of 4/8 bars
  --- Using it every 4/8 bars is a mistake, keep it interesting ie. every 16

2. Drones/Pads/Leads Opening

- The idea is to be any uplifter that is opening and increasing in volume
- Used in combination with other effects
- Depending on genre, could be a saw

3. Filter/Remove

- Get rid of something in that bar that says "Oh, something is about to happen"
  --- Usually people get rid of the kick for a bar or so
- His example: 4 bars where you automate the high pass filter ie. linearly turns on from 29-31, on 31-33, off @33

4. Resampled Reverses

- If we know a piano (synth, etc.) is going to be introduced, we can create a reverse of it to transition
  --- Open new audio lane, turn 'Ext. In' to 'Resampling' [7:40]
  --- Then he grabs only the part of the piano that we want to get the reverse of, and adds reverb to this channel
  --- Resampling basically records anything playing in Ableton, so hit S in the new resampling lane and press record
  ----- Let it play out for a bit after so we have 'source material'
  ----- Click on Clip -> Hit Warp -> Hit Reverse -> Move it a little to the right + fade it, so that we sweep into it [8:51]
  --- This works with higher frequencies vs. a low piano

5. Silence / Motif Centered

- You can execute silence in certain tracks
- He also will give attention to something, this creates a solid transition that's more climatic
  --- 1 bar of everything quiet, give all of the attention to one thing
  --- 1 split seconds of total silence ie. 1/4th bar

Zookeeper - Quickest Way to Balance The Kick & Bass
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/enrolled/1965322

Intro/Setup

- Takes out of the guess work of trying out a new song (the balance of the song)
- This track takes the problem solving out of mixing down the kick/bass
- He does this before trying to play a new song at a gig

Using the Master Chain

1. Low pass filter that is only letting in some bass/sub

- Around 95 Hz and lower

2. Youlean Loudness Meter 2

- Really awesome, free plugin
- Suggested settings: Color thresh up: -23, Thresh down = -70, Transition = Scale offset = None, Scale range: 20

Steps:

1. Solo 1-2 reference tracks

- Pick 1-2 reference tracks with very good/fat mixdowns, hopefully in the same key
- Puts it at -4 dB (this is mastered, trying to match the levels of our non-mastered track)
- Take note of the big peaks around -6 dB (Kick) and lower peaks around -12 dB (Sub)
  --- Pretty much every track that works very good in the club has about 6 dB difference

2. Solo your track

- We can already see that his kick is at -3 and the sub is around -6
- Use utility to bring the levels down to -6 and -12 respectively
  --- If kick goes down 3 and sub goes down 6, then make sure the hats and whatnot go down 3 with the kick

Extra notes:

- You cannot try and accurately do this by ear ie. he cannot hear G# on subs in his room, gets in the car and it is too loud
- The tracks we are trying to reference are going to be more compressed bc they are already mastered
- The envelopes/shapes of his track/reference track #1 were thinner than Biscits
  --- This is because
- The accumulative effects of shaving off a few dB makes a big difference
  --- He took 2-3 dB off the kick and song went from peaking, to not peaking
- After doing these steps, we know the low end is good
  --- If the mid is now missing something, duplicate the bass line and throw on an EQ the filters everything low/high from 154-2000 [10:26]

Zen World - HOW TO Use Your Own Vocals For Tech House
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rooVkz8VfDg&t=3s

This was a joke but try it anyways: "OTT everything that you cannnn" [0:25]

1. Record the vocal

- iPhone works, microphone is recommended

2. Clean up the vocal

- Warp it (so that you can hit on the beat)
- He is using warp markers and putting the transients on (the space between can be warped since it's nothing) [2:30]
  --- Nowadays, you can make just about any sound in the world sound good
- There is going to be background noise, and especially a lot when you start compressing it
  --- Some people record in the closet for pure silence
- Gate [3:20]
  --- Put threshold down to like -50
  --- Anytime the threshold is exceeded, instead of clamping down, it will let the sound out
  --- Attack: 3.50 ms
  --- Release: 6.49 ms
  ----- How long it takes to get back down, He doesn't want his breaths to be heard, so has it at

3. Sound Design

- How to get it dark/deep/fat
- Autotune: uses Autotune Pro in Formant mode [4:34]
  --- Other way to do this is go into the Clip, change Warp mode to Complex Pro
  --- Autotuning keeps the vocals in Key
  --- Dom Dolla uses Soundtoys 'little alterboy' [5:25]

4. Processing

- This is fattening your vocals up
- To keep things simple, all you will do is EQ/Compression/Reverb/Delay
- He uses the Westend Vocals rack (watch here: ) [6:00]
- We want to keep original source (our vocal) so we leverage 'return tracks'
- EQ4: adds air [7:58]
- Soothe2: clamps down on resonance, creating a clean effect (good for if you have harsh vocals)
  --- Higher it is, the harder the vocal hits
- CLA Vocals
  --- Processing and kills dynamics, but it sounds good!
- El Ray

---

5. Extra Credit

- Making your own vocals helps you learn how to keep things interesting in a song
  --- It would get boring hearing the same thing over and over and overal
- Helps you create 'moments' in the track where the vocal sounds different (watch automations video)
- Uses a return track with 'Portal' on it
  --- Sending the vocal to another channel so that you can do more stuff on it (doesn't affect general vocal) [13:00]
  --- Can use this effect to do a lot of cool stuff
- Use little alterboy to pitch the sound of the vocal up/down/etc. [14:40]

Zen World - Made A Song Using Only Loops and Got It Signed
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT004wWPQ74

Notes:

- One of the hardest things is starting an idea (feel like others are more creative)
- It is important to get inspired by multiple people, not just 1

How to make the song more interesting

- Foreshadowing the flute
  --- Too much of a good thing is a bad thing
- Before Drop 1: No flute
- Before Drop 2: Start filtered out + build it up into the drop [5:00]
  --- Only plays part of loop (One things he sees students do the most is duplicating it across, aka no call and response)
- Before Drop 3: Let it go ham

Vocal loop:

- Used be to get into 1st drop
- Later in the track, add reverb which will add harmony/layers to the vocal (metallic sound for stutters) [8:40]
  --- Used in buildup (another vocal lane that's even shorter) [9:20]

Ideas/Takeaway:

- Doing a buildup into the breakdown (so kind of a tease)

Westend - Get This Party Started File
(this is me going through in Ableton and taking notes)

Notes:

Kick:

Low- x4 cutting lows with EQ of Freq 284 and Q=0.63
Mid- x4 cutting sub with EQ of Freq 32 and Q=0.61, there is also some cutting of highs ('8' is x at Freq 13.2, Q = 0.89, '2' is at Freq 3.44, Gain -3.10, Q=0.71)
3rd- x4 cutting lows with EQ of Freq 284 and Q=0.63, also '8' is an x at Freq 18 Q=0.71

Bars 1-9, EQ is on the Kick from

- x4 High Pass Filter w/ Freq = 135, Q = 0.63
  Bars 16-17, EQ goes on to take out the lows (before going back off 1 bar later at 17 - drop effect)
- FX comes in as well
  Bar 25, Vocals come on so the same Filter goes on to nullify the kick
- As well as the filter, there is an Auto Filter starting at Freq=19.9 that goes down to 3.52 by Bar 33 (this filters out kick even more)
  Bar 33-41, The kick is taken away
- Except for 36.3 to 37.1 there are 5 quick kicks, same from 40.3 to 41.1
- The filter taking out the lows is off for the first 5, then it's on for 2nd 5, then take filter off
- EQ Eight Freq goes from 135 to 10 from 40.3 to 41.1, then right back up to Freq of 135 at 41.1
  Bar 41-49, 48.4-49.1, All of the drums and kick cut out
- To prepare for this, the filter cutting lows is back on from 47.1 to 49.1
  Bars 49-57 = Bars 41-49
  Bar 65, The filter has been off since 57 and comes back on now with Freq=10
  Bar 73, The kick hits and goes away as there is a release/downlifters and synth
  Bar 84.3-85.1, 5 kicks with filter still on
  Bar 96.3-97.1, 5 kicks before kick comes back
- The filter taking out the lows is off for the first 5, then it's on for 2nd 5, then take filter off
- EQ Eight Freq goes from 135 to 10 from 40.3 to 41.1, then right back up to Freq of 135 at 41.1
  Bar 104, Filter goes on until 105 w/ Freq=135
- There is also the break in drums from 104.4-105.1
  Bar 112, the same things happens in Bars 105-113
  Bars 113-153, Kick keeps firing with the filter off

Bass:

Bass Melody:
Bass One Shots:
Real Bass:

- LFO Tool is on whenever the bass layers are playing
  --- Exception is between 25-33 there is sub/low bass playing w/ LFO off, EQ of '1' at Freq 147, Q=0.63 on
  --- Bass EQ Eight also comes on at Bar 56-57 and 112-113 when the drums/etc. are cut
- Before drop at 97, at 89 the Filter comes on with '1' at 386/Q=0.63 and by Bar 97 it is at 147, then it is off

CLA-3A Compressor / Limiter is on, which I do not have
LFOTool replaced with Kickstart
Trackspacer is used after LFOTool, not sure what his setting were

Consists of 2 layers of 'ikin bass', one appears to have sub/lows, the 2nd has lows and mids

- Comes in at bar 17, plays pretty much anytime the kick is
- They both plays for the most part, the first one with sub/lows plays in about 15 more bars though

Drums:

- Automations on entire drum group for Auto Filter (25-33 to dull out drums, 33-41 to bring them back) and Endless Smile (Before drop at 89-97)

Clap:
Plays anytime the kick is going in the song, a few times too where it is not

- Main: Volume 0
- Left: Volume -16.1, 50L
- Right: Same as left, but 50R

Skippy Hat:

- Not really sure, it probably adds value though (Plays wherever the clap does, 7L, Volume -17.1)

Hats:

Main Hat:

- 7 layers: Open, Lazy Hit, Drums Woody Top, idk, Shaker, Shaker Layer, Transient layer
- Hats progress throughout
- A couple are panned L/R, for the mostpart things are Centered with varying volume

Loops:

- Shaker loop from 49-65, 105-121 (only high freqs: '1' is EQ at x w/ Freq=711, Q=0.69, Volume =-14.7, 11R)

Supplementary:

- Closed hat, Starting at Bar 42, claps right after 42.3.2, 44.3.2, till 64.3.2, then from 98 to 136

Fluffy rides: (unnamed, I named it ride)

- Goes from 113-121, adds value to the last drop going into the outro

Percussion:

- Perc1 (029 Percussion.wav): Hits every other kick, seems to be there to add a bit of punch to the kick (-30 Vol, 19R)
- Clave:
- Cowbell:
- Bongos:

Snare:

Zen World - How I Use Multiband Compression On The Master
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH2aZYUV7_I

plugin: FabFilter Pro-MB

He likes to have a couple of bands (to separate the groups of Frequencies)

- Low band (around 105)
- Mid/Low band (around 500)
- Mid band (around 4-5,000)
- High band (around 30,000)

Low:

- When looking in Voxengo SPAN, lots of movement/it is dynamic (this is bad, we want a tight low end)
- Pulls back threshold until he feels they are together / more stable low end
  --- Note: Volume is lost when you do this, but you can move gain level up to compensate (he does 2 dB)
- Add a little release to 32%, put lookahead to 20ms

Mid/Low:

- Moves down Threshold some and puts gain up

Mid:

- The higher the 'knee', the softer it gets
  --- If we approach the threshold, it already starts to compress
- Pulls back threshold to middle, moves attack up to 11 oclock, boosts level 4dB

High:

- Pulls back threshold to 11 oclock, gain up to 4 dB

Takeaways:

- Kick is no longer king-kong, even though we didn't lose a lot of volume
- The lead sounds more pleasing to hear
- Kick and clap get much more punchy
- High's sound more balance, open hat is getting tamed
- He ends with an EQ Eight that brings down some mid/lows and boosts the leads (mids) and highs
- Most important thing is to not mess up your frequency balance

Zen World - This Tip Helped me Understand Compression
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TqTPdl7KmY

- Think of learning compression as finding Jesus/the Holy Grail
- This also works for Reverb/Delay/etc.

Compression = Volume Automation

Kick:

- He starts by putting Ratio at 4:20:1, Turning off Makeup, Lower threshold all the way
- Attack: The more we raise attack, the more that's being let through the Compressor
- Release:
  --- We usually want gain reduction to return to 0 aka no volume reduced

Notes:

- The compressed kick has a downward shift/cone shape, it is more snappy (bahhh sounds vs. bah)

Drums:

- Lower threshold all the way, start with attack + release down too
- He starts messing with everything doing it by ear
  --- Add a little makeup gain too, maybe

Notes:

- High hat/Open hat kind of sounds, you will definitely hear the compression (it pushes it more up/more excitement)

Takeaways:

- Compression helps with thing sitting better in the mix

Westend - Latin Tech House Track From Scratch
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/latin-tech-house-track-from-scratch-westend/lectures/44631357

Building the Groove:

Bongos

- Percussive loop (Volume -4, EQ out below 100 + raise mids)

Hats

- Uses a Hat loop in Tamb (Tamborine, Volume -6)

Clap

- We don't want a really long tail on the main clap (Volume -8.2)

Shaker

- Definitely want a shaker (Volume -10)

Kick

- Uses a loop (Volume -6)

Pads/Atmosphere

- Vinyl noise for some Background noise the whole track (Volume -14, EQ out sub)
- Important to fill out the stereo fill since we do not have synths
- Can automate this to be rising up from intro-start of vocal-breakdown

Percussion -> Random

- Goes on Splice 'Toolroom Tribal Tech House' -> Percussion -> Percussion Loop
- Messes with transients [5:50] Volume -6

Percussion -> Cowbell

- Ibiza Tech House percusssion loop (Volume -10)

Note: He groups together Bongos and Random, puts on Auto Pan with the following
(this is for stereo movement)

- Change Hz to notes, Amount 33%, Rate 1/2, Phase 180, Shape 0

Groove sounds solid, time to add some more

- Adds a clap at end of 4th Bar ie. Hat at 4.4.4 (Volume -10)
- Double kick at end of 4th bar (Between Kick at 4.3 and 4.4) (Use fade to make it shorter)
- Adds part of a drum loop at end of 4th bar (Keeps parts he wants, Volume -10)
- Adds another John Summit kick for more top end (Shorten it up, fade out most, EQ sub/lows at 400, Volume )

Finding a Vocal:

- We want the vocal so we know the key for bass line, synths and more
- He finds Latin Vocal Flavours

Writing a Bass Line:
Serum Sound:
Picks BA - Sustainerzzz (from Deceiver Vol 5)

- Adds Kickstart 2, Makes the Input the Kick, Changes Setting to Audio (Picks Tighter chain and moves it right)

Groove:

- Getting a groove that doesn't suck is "very important" because it needs to match the
- Tip: Take the vocal and copy it into a melody, this is Ableton telling what it thinks the melody is
  --- From there, you can make a bass line, take notice of the notes used in this melody
- Another tip: Write bass line an octave up to help you hear the notes better
  --- Muting the vocal may be necessary to get a pattern that you like
- Once you find a groove, move the notes off the grid a little bit

More Serum:

- Look for ways to automate the bass line (He is doing the 'Harder' up at end of bars)
- Note on Kickstar 2: Multiband Sidechain: "Only sidechain frequencies UNDER the slider"

Adding Atmosphere:

He really likes to use loops and chop them up

- Goes on Splice looking for a Synth Pad
  Intro to Resampling: [0:30]
- Throw reverb on
- 'Freeze' button on, Turn off 'Cut' (This makes the reverb basically go on forever)
- Right click on Pads track w/ Ghostly pad in it -> Freeze track
- Flatten track
- (I think) he then took the last 4 bars and replaced the beginning
- Add sidechain

Note: Don't be afraid to do crazy/random EQ's on your atmopshere

- You are just trying to get character, leave room for vocal

Quickly Arranging & Automating:

- 32 bar intro,
- Bass comes in at 17, so EQ out lows of Kick from 1-16, 17-29
- Make Bars 17-33 to simple part of the bass only (No movement)

Reverse reverb / freeze and flatten trick
(This is all easy since vocal comes in right at 33):

- New track under vocal, take the First 1/4 bar, bring down, reverse it
- Add Ableton stock reverb, Dry/Wet 100, Freeze On, Cut Off, Input filter Hi Cut+Diffusion High off, as well
- Freeze track, then Flatten track, Grab the 1/4 Bar + 8 Bars for 1/4 bar lead into 25-33
- Consolidate, Reverse, line up 1/4 in correct spot so there's 8 bars behind
- Fade in by draggin top left in and to the right
- Line it up so the tip/peak starts going down when the vocal starts talking
  Optional, add Delay:
- Ableton Stock Delay
- Left = 4, Feedback 31%, Dry/Wet 29%, Ping Pong on, Width 4.75
- We get a tail here, it is almost like a crash
  --- Can automate dry/wet from 0 to 30-40 if you want

Breakdown:

- Take the first part of loop since it is easier to loop/cut/go over
  --- The point of latin house is the loop the vocal instead of using synths
- Bring in the reverse reverb again for right before start of breakdown (49)
- Vocal looping with drums cutoff = Perfect opportunity for a snare roll (7 bars from 57-64)
  --- Pitch bend up to end snare roll
- Long sweep from 49-65 (begins filtered out)
- For 64-65, instead of another loop of vocal, grab another part of the initial 8 bars that is interesting (Drop is at 65)
- Bring in the open hat loop for 57-64
- Kick roll from 63-64 (8 kicks total)

Building the Drop:

- Bring back in Kick/Bass/Drums
- Extra beafier drums since everyone is fully engaged into the song
- He wants something else going on in the drop, the reference track has 2 diff vocal chops
  --- He looks at 'Slice to MIDI track' method as well as Sting64, opts for doing it by hand
- Ends up chopping the vocal into 4 bars of 4 bars [5:45]
  Ear Candy:
  (Now that the idea is solid, how can we will it out more?)
- Expand the drums with more percussion/top loops
  --- Idk if I like this shortening up, does Beats -> Transient -> Right Arrow -> 100 down to 67
- Adds another one shot hat throughout drop (Volume -8)
- Adds some fill loop at end of 8 bars ie. at 72 right before 73
- Another idea: Make the sound wider (using VST - Wider, He does this with the vocal to 30%)
- Adds Cowbell loop from Toolroom Academy - Tech House London (I like this - ta_tth_drums_023_cowbell_124_Am -> narrow search to cowbell)
  --- Adds to 2nd part of drop, 73-81
- Another great idea: Have a 2nd vocal, very short+quiet, that we Auto Pan [15:30]
- Can also take the last 8th/16th of snare roll and bring to end of drop, while bringin down kick
- Alternative to white noise downsweep at end of drop (I like this - Sounds like smoke machine) [20:00]

Westend Feat. Joel Corry - Track Breakdown
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/joel-corry-westend-remix-track-breakdown/lectures/42072733

High Level before starting a remix:

1. What is the mood/vibe of his track? (feel good vs. chill vs. banger vs. club friendly vs. groovy)

- Don't want mine to be the same sound/genre
- Joel's is a feel good/commercial pop song for the radio
- Westend will make something darker / more gritty / synths

2. What are the parts of the original? (Stems)

- Should get the stems of the song
- Ableton tip: Turn off 'auto warp long samples'
- Vocals are nearly a necessity (how people will remember the original)
- Likes to use all of his own drums

Arrangement:

- ***

VSTs & Plugins - Westend
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/vsts-plugins/lectures/43757094

Philosphy on VST's: Ableton comes with everything you need, plugins are just there to upgrade/add new tools to your arsenal

EQ, Filter, Sidechain:

- Fabfilter Pro-Q3: EQ Eight but better
- FilterFreak2: Soundtoys Auto Filter, more advanced w/ presets
- LFTTool: Sidechain tool that's good for the bass
- LittleAlterboy: Soundtoys, Classic way to get squeaky vocals

Reverb & Delay:
(Adding wetness to sounds, building tension)

- Delay: Ableton's, very good
- Reverb: One of favorite Ableton plugins, nice sound + easy to program
- Vocoder: Carrier signal carries the melodies, uses with snare roll
- Crystalizer: Soundtoys, similar to grain delay, can make some glitchy sounds
- EchoBoy: Soundtoys, alternative to Ableton Delay
- Endless Smile: Top 5 plugin, uses it in every track
- Portal: Insanely good presets, similar to Crystalizer
- Tremolator: Soundtoys, good for adding movement to sound, 'd-d-d-d' effect

Instruments:
(Sounds generating plugins, he only uses external over Ableton)

- Operator: Ableton synths
- Simpler: Good for dropping in a sample
- Diva: Great analog emulator, less digital than Serum
- Kontakt: High quality strings, etc.
- M1: Korg, must get plugin for piano house (or TruePiano)
- Massive: Classic synth, 3 years ago this is all that he used until he got Serum presets
- Serum: Favorite/Amazing synthesizer, most guys on Youtube make them for Serum (Great for learning Synthesis)
- Sylenth1: Simimar to Diva, solid

Saturation & Compression:

- Drum Buss: Ableton, good to make drums fatter
- Saturator: Ableton,
- CLA Vocals Saturator: He doesn't use it much, lots of people he works with do
- Decapitator: Soundtoys, really nice sounding saturator with great presets
  --- (Bass -> Beefy, Drums -> DrumFattener 1)
- DevilLoc: Soundtoys, similar to Ableton's Overdrive
- FabFilter Pro C: Go-to Saturator if not using Ableton
- FabFilter Saturn: Amazing, allows you to create bands
- OTT: Xfer, Over the top compression, brings out high frequencies, be careful on using too much
- Radiator: Soundtoys, great for adding heat to a hat buss
- SausageFattener: Nice for adding something fat
- Thermal: Favorite plugin, it is Saturation, amazing presets to change up your sound (highly recommend this + Portal)

Stereo & Mastering:
(Stereo = everything about volume)

- Auto Pan: Ableton, great for stereo movement
- Utility: Listening to track in Mono, Bass Mono for making anythin under x frequency Mono
- MicroShift: Soundtoys, great for widening vocals + adding coarse to sounds
- Ozone 9: For being specific about multiband (ie. widen highs, narrow lows)
- PanMan: Just like Auto Pan, have more control (Smooth knob for smoothening it out, width for how far it goes)
- PhaseMistress: Soundtoys, phaser kind of like a stereo effect
- Voxengo MSED: Can mute mono signal and listen to stereo, great for improving mixdowns (Free also)
  (Mastering = Mixing + Mastering)
- Tuner: To know what key something is in
- FabFilter Pro L2: Favorite Limiter, great visually, favorite stand alone plugin, saw Odd Mob using this
- FabFilter Pro MB: Multiband Compressor, other producers swear by it
- Gem Dopamine: Great for adding brightness/high freqs to vocals, got from Disclosure video
- NS1 Stereo: Can remove background noise from your sound, more sophisticated than a gate
- Oxford Inflator: Good for master, people use it to get big sound without clipping (it is like cheating)
- Ozone 9: Favorite mastering plugin ever, has AI based mastering helper (great for quick mastering)
- RBass Stereo: Good for helping the sub be audible, saturates harmonics
- soothe2: "it is crazy, probably the best mixing plugin" As your track is playing, brings down any resonance frequencies, adjusts on the fly
- Tonal Balance Control: Good for emulating another track, as you enter in another and check if the frequency bands are in the same realm
- Trackspacer: 2nd favorite mixing plugin, dynamic sidechain ie. put on a vocal and send synth as input, everytime synth plays the vocal will duck (good for competing space)
- Voxengo SPAN: Great for seeing all of the frequencies of your track, put on mixing bus and compare to another track

SYNTHESIS 101: BEGINNER TO ADVANCED
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2qgam6W_u4

0. Envelopes vs. LFO
   Envelope:

- Shaping tool that plays 1x
- Usually have 4-5 basic controls
  Attack: How long it takes to reach to the top
  Hold: How long it stays there
  Decay: How long it takes to reach the sustain level
  Sustain: The level it goes down to after attack/hold
  Release: How long it takes sustain to reach silence

LFO (Low Frequency Oscilator):

- Plays repeatedly
- Can add multiple points
- Envelope mode will make it cycle only once

1. Volume/Amplitude Modulation

2.

Drum Layering - Westend
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/drum-layering-westend/lectures/43701047

Overview:

1. Volume
2. Frequency
3. Stereo Feel (width)

Off the bat, if you layer the following, you set yourself up for a better track:

- Kick
- Open Hat
- Clap

Layering the Kick:

- Samples matter, some go better with each other
  --- We have tools to make them blend together better

1. Low end/punchy kick

- You can find what key a kick is in with EQ Eight (low pass EQ, then double click, then solo kick and hover over high freqs)
  --- If you want to chance key ie. go from F to G#, put kick in Complex mode and +2 semitones

2. Mid kick

- Top end can really make your kick stand out on all devices
  --- See how 1 kick is around 0 dB on EQ Eight at 600ish dB
- We only want higher frequencies, so do 2 things:
  --- Shorten clip/fade out end
  --- EQ out low end info around 350
- Mixing now comes into play now: (try both to see what you like more)
  --- Way 1: start with 2nd kick way up and lower until you can hardly hear it
  --- Way 2: start with 2nd kick way down and increase until you like it
  ----- Hold shift while moving volume down
- Adding these new frequencies gives perceived volume without adding to volume
  --- More headroom later for mastering the track

3. High kick

- Only for the higher frequencies
- High pass EQ only allowing in

4. Entire Buss

- Compressor/Limiter/Saturation/Drum Buss

Layering the Clap:

- Sometimes you want big/wide, sometimes you want snare/unique

1. Center

- Most prominent
- Want our drums short/punchy, make sure to shorten up all the way with clip fade
- Probs will be too loud, lower volume before proceeding

2. Left/Right

- For adding width/big sound
- We want a completely different sample (phasing issue will arise)
  --- He finds a super punchy sound
  --- They don't have to be the same sample
- Use Voxengo MSED, mute Mono signal (to hear only L/R) and

3. Texture

- For grit/uniqueness (Could be a really weird sound)

4. Entire Buss

- FabFilter Saturn/Decapitator for Saturator, EQ lows, Voxengo MSED
  Importance for each Clap
- Volume
- EQ'ing (Shave out volume where we can, cut out lows/sub for all)

Layering the Hats:

- Huge sound in tech house, each track will sound different tho
- Some use closed hats
  Main Hat:

1. Open layer (Main sound)

- Shape it to be shorter
- Lower volume to fit in the mix before proceeding

2. Shaker

- Mid punch and width ('ch' sound from 500-2000)
- Adds to acoustic house sound instead of the metallic sound from one hat
  --- Look for a sample that has the frequencies that the main hat does not
- May need to use Utility to bring width down

3. Transient

- Tick at the beginning (usually a closed hi hat)
- Transient starts right at the beginning
  --- EQ out lows and mids
- Sits at lower volume in the mix

4. Entire Buss

- Parallel reverb
  --- Take a reverb, right click to group it, click 3 lines, duplicate and rename
  --- Wet chain: Dry/Wet 100% in Reverb, -11 dB Volume in Chain, Decay = 500ms (Reverb gels the samples together, adds tail)
  --- Dry chain: Dry/Wet 0% in Reverb, 0 dB Volume in Chain
- EQ until it sounds better
- Check Voxengo SPAN at this point to compare width of kick/clap/hats to reference track
  Importance for each Hat
- EQ out low end information

Track Breakdown: Yeah Yeah (Black V Neck Remix) Part 1 - Producer Mindset
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/track-breakdown-yeah-yeah-black-v-neck-remix-part-1/lectures/43529730

Intro:

- A song they listened to when they were up and coming
- Wanted to showcase the vocal and famous synth
- Keeping their sound while also incorporating as much of the original as possible
- Remix = Easier because there is already an idea (vs. creating an idea)

Intro:

- 1 minute intro/outro
- Bass drops at 17
- Kick is off from 16-17 (also there is a riser from 13-16.4

First Buildup:

- Shaker starts at 25
- Tom comes in at 33
- Uplifter into 33 (possibly downlifter at 33 as well)
- Crash at 41
- Vocal is teased from 17-33 4x, 33-49 is 16 bars of the actual song's lyrics nonstop
- Snare roll 41-48 (something 'big' is about to happen) (also, everything is off from 48-49)
- Atmosphere noise from 44-48
- Black V Neck 4 bar riser from 41-49 (looks like the end of a downlifter)

First Drop:

- Crash/Downlifter at 49 (effects end at 50)
- Plays synth snippet which last 1/4 a bar at 49.4, 51.4, 53.4, 55.4
- Kick is taken out for effect at 53.4 during synth, as well as at 56.4 as a fill
- At 57 we add in a Tom, 808 Rim, & Shaker (Shaker continues on, others end at 65)
- Also at 57, 4 fx 'noises' at 57.1.1, 57.1.2, 57.1.3, 57.1.4 and then at 57.2 another crash

Breakdown and Buildup 2:

- at 65-81, instead of synth chops we have full synth, the "I can teach ya" vocal is looped,
  --- Synth and vocal loop have an auto filter that opens up gradually
- Synth chops in 80.4-81
- 65-80.4, 16 bar BVN riser as well as Serum riser (the one I struggled to replicate with the rate doubling at 9, 13, 15)
- Crash at 65/73
- Black V Neck fall at 65 which fades into 69, KSHMR Sub drop at 73
- Addition to 2nd drop: Vocal chops w/ Little Alterboy (pitched down) ("I can teach.. I.. I can teach, repeat)
- They talk about making sure to have the groove on all of the drums (anything syncopated is swung 99.9% of the time)
  Filtered section starts at 97 till 105
- Kick gone at 85.4, also from 88.1-88.4
- Shaker is gone from 81-89
- At 89, Shaker comes back, Ride loop comes in, groove snare is fully in
- At 97-101, it is only Kick and Synth leads
- At 101-105, Clap comes back
- At 105-112.4, 113-121, Hi hat comes back
- Full vocal is coming in at 105 for the OG fans (Reverse vocal from 103-105 to help transition)
- Bass line changes at 105 to match the melody w/ the vocal (the chord progression wouldn't match)
- 2 Bar Black V Neck fall at 105
  Buildup
- 16 bar snare roll at 113-129, Open up sustain automatically from -11 to -1 at 125-129
- Accompanied by the 2 16 bar Risers (I don't hear if the rate doubles for this one)
- Clap/Hi hat/s Reverb Dry/Wet goes from 0-50 in this 16 bars to make the hats/clap sound farther and farther away (Chris Lake trick)
- Reverse vocal comes in till 129
- Uses SoundToys Crystalizer to pitch up the voice (Pitch = Max, Dry/Wet = 40%) note: this is before auto filter

Final Drop and Outro

- Essential bar of track is 129-130 since it is actually supposed to drop at 129, not 130
  --- Walker & Royce said they were missing an 'Oh shit!' moment
- 1st bar has nothing from 129.1-129.3 for kick, then 4 kicks 'to the face' with filter to dampen kick
- Crash at 130
- Everything besides 808 rim is on from 130-136.4, after the fill everything comes in
- Not sure if I like this [11:45] Vocal loop filters out from 121-129, so that vocal chops can start at 125 and build up into the drop
  --- This is interesting and makes it hard to throw off the 8 counts
- Crash at 137.2 and 145
- Added ear candy from 130 to 145 and beyond, a 'String'
- 4 bar riser from 141-145, ride comes off at 145 (This is the last drop where the Outro begins)
- Little alterboy used in a cool way [4:30]
- Outro goes 1 minute/32 bars
- Slowly remove elements (fast shaker and 808 rim gone at 161, Groove snare at 153)
  --- The last 30 seconds I see kick/clap/hi hat/shaker/tom

Track Breakdown: Yeah Yeah (Black V Neck Remix) Part 2 - Engineer Mindset

Intro to Mixing and Mastering:

- Organization groups: Drums,
- Top down (doing drum bus first) vs. Bottom up mixing (doing channels before busses)
- Always know what you are putting into your projects + why

Drums:

- Drum Buss has Glue Compressor w/ Attack=10, Release=0.1, Ratio=10, Threshold=-21.9, Makeup=3dB, Soft Clip is Orange, Range=10dB, Dry/Wet=35%
  --- Signals into the bus are untouched, when adding a saturator/compressor I guess this changes
  --- Remember: Humans like the sound of saturation
- Clap and Hi Hat: from 33-39, 65-81, 113-129 the Reverb Dry/Wet goes linear from 0 to 35-50ish (these are the 16 bar buildups before the drops)
  Kick
- This kick is weird, don't copy
- Bus: EQ has x4 at 20, mids are 1k are ducked, x4 for '8' at right side, Glue Compressor w/ Makeup 10.2 and Dry/Wet 100%, EQ Eight for when we want to reduce lows of kick
- Bottom: EQ with '7' at 102 (this kick has good impact/thud, not the top end though)
- Top: EQ with curved x's around 200 and 10k
- Note: They hate layering kicks
- Another note: They are writing kicks in MIDI with a Simpler
  Clap
- MIDI Simpler of Noizu clap tech house classic 03
- Side Widener: Makes life easier for Mono-Compatibility, I would not suggest to use this without using SENNHEISER HD 6XX HEADPHONES [7:00]
- Utility with Bass Mono on 160 (anything below 160 will stay in Mono)
- Reverb with 23% dry/wet to add tail/dimension to track
- EQ Eight removing anything below 300 / above 10-11k (MAKE SURE to do this - there is a negligible different)
- KClip3: This is for clipping/headroom
  --- See the 2dB of headroom we saved [19:32] for when we squash the record with our Limiter (Clipping usually occurs on the 2 claps)
  --- Notes: In Engineering, crest factor is the ratio of peak values to the effective value (In Ableton, RMS is light green, peak value is white line, crest factor is the stuff in between) (We want to minimize crest)
  --- Loudness does not come from the master - it comes from the mix, and the crest factor is single handedly responsible for the loudness you can crank w/o Distortion (although everything has diminishing returns)
  --- Clipping = Saturation
  --- Hard Clipping is squaring off what passes the threshold, Soft clip is a curve/reshape, but still allows saturation
- Reverb that has automation for buildups, so it starts at 0
  Hi Hat
- EQ with '1' as x4 around 900 and '8' is x4 right before end at the right
- KCLip3 (saved 2.4 dB headroom)
- Reverb for buildups
  Shaker
- EQ to allow between 1k and end at the right, dip down in the middle of that around 8-9k
- Possibly another EQ to remove loud 'shimering'
  Tom
- MIDI plays at 2 spots, looks like middle of 1 and 2 and then between 4 and end
- EQ with 1 at 153 and 8 cutting off the end
  --- Note: Ableton's x4 24 filter effects the phase
  --- Note: You can flip phase 180 degrees w/ Utility and clicking L and R (this inverts the waveform)
  --- EQ Eight does not actually do this, may experience issues depending on where the filter is set (hard to know if you don't have trained ears) [24:25]
  Fast Shaker
- EQ cutting anything below 1k and above 11k
  --- Note: We take out high end of anything that is not the Hi Hat (that should be the primary up-beat mover thing)
- Auto Pan: Amount 35%, Rate 1/8, Phase 180, Shape 28%, Offset 180, Sine Wave
- LFO Tool: I will put on Kickstart
  808 Rim
- Adds color with Saturation
- d-d-d-d d-d-d [30:25]
- SideWidener, Utility with 160 Bass Mono, Saturator with 9 dB drive and Soft Clip On 100% Dry/Wet, EQ Eight allowing in 350-end
  Ride
- EQ allowing in 900-end, ducked down around 4-5k
- Normally they would Auto Pan the ride (this sample had it already I think)
  Build Snare
- Snare Roll, EQ allowing in 150-end, duckaround 1k
- Automation of the ducking at 100 that ends up being up above
- Sometimes they add reverb like hats / claps automation
  Groove Snare
- EQ from 200-end

Bass & Synths:
Bass

- MIDI Channel with a Simpler and Bass One Shot in the Key of C [0:08]
- Saturator with 4 dB of Drive
- EQ Eight that allows in 70-95-800 in weird triangle shape (this is automated to only be on during drop at 65-81, drop at 113-129, and 161 till end)
- Fabfilter Pro MB / KClip3
- Compressor that is sidechaining with a Band of 320 Hz ie. it only listens for frequencies ABOVE 320 Hz
- Note: This bass wave starts going down before up (unlike the kick drum) so this causing phasing cancellation issues
  --- We need to flip the phase of kick/bass or else the kick drum won't knock as hard (He uses Virtual Mix Rack to do this, Ableton Utility works too)
  Leads
- Buss has Glue Compressor w/ Attack 3, Release .6, Ratio 2, Threshold 0, Makeup 0, Soft Clip on, Range 10 dB, Dry/Wet 35%
- Lead 1, which is treated as a synth, has EQ from 300-end (a riser sent from remix pack, also has little 'whoop' during drops/even buildups)
- Synth 2, the famous synth, plays in chops from 33-65, 65-81, chops from 81-97, in full from 97-129, chops 129-145
  --- EQ from 175-end
  --- Replika plugin to add mono-compatible width/dimension, Mix also automates up before drops (can also do this with Delay - Decay super short, Little Mix, add some feedback [6:20] - would automate wet/dry and decay I think)
  --- Auto Filter that opens up at beginning of buildup areas
- String for Atmosphere sound in last drop, needs EQ and Kickstart / LFO Tool
  --- Check for correct key by a Tuner, or putting up a Piano or something in correct key, and moving the sound around the Piano until it sounds right
- Last Synth, a Vocal Pitched down

The Vocal

- Vocals Buss: Glue Compressor w/ Attack .01, Release .6, Ratio 4, Threshold -21, Makeup 3.49, Soft Clip on, Range 10 (always at 10 since he doesn't like any gain reduction past this), Dry/Wet 50%
- Main Vocal Bus: Glue Compressor w/ Attack .01, Release .6, Ratio 4, Threshold -22.2, Makeup 4.6, Soft Clip on, Range 10, Dry/Wet 100%
- Main Vocal 1: Plays from 33-49 Buildup, 65-81, 105-129 (this has lots of chops starting at 113)
  --- EQ allowing in 250-end, Soundtoys Crystalizer + Auto Filter + Reverb used to automate up before 2nd/3rd drops, Sidechain Compressor at end
- Chop: Plays 81-97 buildup, 125-145 also
  --- Little Alterboy (formant is automated weird for side information[3:15]), EQ for 250-end, Replika, Auto Filter, Reverb, LFT Tool
- Background Noise / Atmosphere 1: Plays has EQ from 250-end
- Reverse vocals with EQ 275-end, Reverb 42% Dry/Wet, LFT Tool

FX:

- He begins by talking about how many people have FX that are way too loud, how everything is relative in the mix
- Bus: Glue Compressor w/ Attack .01, Release .6, Ratio 4, Threshold 0, Makeup 0, Soft Clip on, Range 10, Dry/Wet 50%
- Noise, Volume -12, Weird ass EQ from 450-end with bump up around 1500, Virtual Mix Rack, SideWidener, LFT Tool
- Crash, Volume -13.5,
- Black V Neck 16 Bar Riser, Volume -15, EQ from 90-end, Plays 8 bars in Drop 1, 15+3/4 bars in 2nd/3rd
- Serum Sine Riser, Volume -12, EQ from 200-end, plays 15+3/4 bars in 2nd and 3rd drops [1:45]
  --- Has the rate that automates up, still not sure how to replicate this (Rate starts 19% for bars 1-9, 48% 9-13, up to 65-70 13-15, up 90-100 15-16.4)
- Sub Impacts/Downlifters, Volume -15, uses samples from BVN for drops and KSHMR for breakdowns
- Scratch, Volume -9, used once at 57 (I like this d-d-d-d sound)

Gainstaging & Plugins:

- The whole pre-master strip is for color + glue, not loudness (contrary to popular belief - adds only 2 dB of loudness)
  --- Saturation and glue compressors on the busses is for communication for anything passing through them
- Everyting gels better with it on
- True Iron: A transformer based saturation, he has Crush 2.0 dB and Mix 100% (to get the sound of saturation to come in more going thru rest of the chain)
- Utility: Gain Staging -3 dB: To reduce the gain after saturating
  --- When you use plugins that emulate analog technology, they are not expecting a hot ass signal to pass thru them (it will saturate/clip them, we don't want that clipping)
- UAD Dangerous: A high pass filter, this is very very low
  --- Having it on the Master ensures that you are not ruining / phasing individual elements (phasing relationships could change on individual busses) [5:15]
- Ozone 9: Not sure what is going on here really [6:30]
  --- He only uses multiband as a low-end glue
- UAD Oxford EQ: Checks the high end (idk if you can hear the difference - apparently it helps remove very high end which could be harsh sounds)
- Ozone 9 Imager: To make sure the bottom end is completely in Mono up until a certain point (160 Hz) [8:10]
- UAD Manley: Assists the mid-range [8:55]
  --- Majority of color comes from this
- UAD Precision: Maximizer that is used for a lot of color (it also adds 3 dB of gain) [10:00]
  --- The loudness is then checked out with another Utility for Gain Reduction

- Tip: Constantly A/B things (it really is as simple as "do I like this on the mix" or "does this make the mix better")

Mastering:

- KClip3: Doesn't do much, it acts as a safety net [0:40]
- Utility: 3 db Gain
- Ozone 9 Maximizer: He now does 1-2 db Gain Reduction w/ a Pro L2 with lookahead to prevent the amount of un-wanted distortion
  --- This also has automation on the Maximizer -> MAX Threshold (it looks random/erratic - it has a purpose)
  --- This helps make the drops sound like drops, and buildups/breakdowns to sound like buildups/breakdowns
  ----- "This section is more exciting than this one"
  ----- Some just adjust volume vs. doing this, but it is not enough (When you adjust volume, the peak is being lowered, as well as RMS/crest factor)
- Youlean Loudness Meter 2: Only reason we push records this later is because "we have to play them"
  --- it has to mach the genre, which is why referencing tracks helps
  --- Putting in a reference track that goes to Ext. Out

Final Thoughts:

- Every sound you pick matters (no EQ or coloring can fix a bad sound)
  --- Trimming fat, not changing color

HOW TO CREATE MASHUPS || WEDAMNZ TUTORIAL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqK8odrnFsE

Traktor Scratch Pro:

- He starts in Traktor because it is easy to check what Key / BPM is
  --- also uses it for live sets
- He gets most of his acapellas from Google (MS Project Sound, Vocal it,

FL Studio:

- First thing that he checks is the key of the songs
- He uses Song BPM to get true BPM

Tips:

- Use Reverb on Acapella so that at the drop it doesn't end harshly (he also adds delay)

(In general, both reverb and delay are similar time based effects. the main difference is:
reverb emulates sound waves reflecting off surfaces to create a sense of three dimensional space.
delay will create a copy of a signal and play it back at a desired time interval to emulate an echo effect.)
Delay = A delay is nothing more than the same original audio signal being repeated again and again after a short period of time.
The number of times the signal is repeated is called feedback.
Reverb = It’s when the soundwaves bounce off every surrounding surface and then reach our ears at slightly different times. (This gives us the perception of space when hearing)
Reverb can also be viewed as a lot of differently timed delays with different feedbacks which sort of “blur” together, giving the perception of space and depth.

- He changes the master volume to go down during the build up and spike up right at the drop
  --- Reference Black V Neck video to do the gain staging that way instead (for max perceived loudness)

Tempo Change:

- He mentions that some mashups have a tempo change
  --- Slide mashup he brings from 110 to 128
- From bar 57 to 65 he automates BPMTempo to go from 110 to 128
  --- This is while the 2nd track is teased in
  --- He also uses 'WeDamnz Perfect Snap' at the 2 and 4 to serve as a clap
  --- I believe for this to work, you'll have to have an 8 bar Acapella for 1st song at lower BPM, or go into Beats -> Transient to move everything from 57-58..-65 to be on the kick beat

HOW TO CREATE MASHUPS - 2 || WEDAMNZ TUTORIAL
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYHJu76u0So

1. Getting ingredients

- Acapellas/Instrumentals: voclr.it OR whosampled.com to find where they got it from
- Extended/Original Mixes: Beatport.com
- Looking for top songs: 1001tracklists.com

2. Pre-mixing in Traktor

- Always making sure that it is in key ie. Pitch C is sounds like the most stable home note or "tonic"
  --- He pitches up Senorita 1 whole tone / 2 semitones to match Turn me on
  --- He pitches Sweet Dreams down 2 whole tones / 4 semitones to match Piece of your heart
  --- He pitches I want it that way up

3. Creating the mashup in Ableton

- He extends the senorita mix himself
- Uses a lot of snares and risers during the transition
- Use reverb/delay at the end of the acapella
  --- Soundtoys EchoBoy
  --- Low filter when the drop hits to remove low frequencies, Sidechaining to help with that
- To make drops hard, automates gain knob on Utility to be quieter during breakdowns and louder at buildups

Disco Lines - if TAYLOR SWIFT went ONE DEEPER
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_htjZypLnEs&t=222s

- Warp Vocals to original BPM
- Set song tempo to 128 BPM
- Get the acapella (it looks like the beginning of the remix uses the real song, we use the acapella starting in the drop when the bass line comes in)
- Lay down a kick and clap
- Get chord progression, so that we can use them and/or develop a bass line from it
- Bass line is 2 FM sine waves that are panned hard L and hard R for stereo width, using a filter (Filter MG Low 18) to automate cutoff
  Steps taken on Acapella to make vocals sound better during the drop:
- EQ with '1' at 284 Hz / Q = 0.78
- FabFilter Compressor for life/agression (His dry/wet looks around 40%) [2:42]
- Chorus for more width (Delay 1: Highpass 751 Hz, 3ms, Delay 2: Mod, 7 ms, Modulation: Amount=0.42 ms, Rate=3.32 Hz, Polarity +, Feedback 0, Dry/Wet 37%)
- Reverb for smoother sound (Dry/Wet is 48%) [2:50]
- OTT [2:51]
- Glue Compressor w/ Sidechain [2:54]
- EQ Eight '1' at 499 Hz / Q = 0.71
  More:
- Add hats in various spots to increase sex appeal
- Add a simple buildup with Snare Tur (4 bars of 4 on the floor, 2 bars of 8, 1 bar of 16, 1 bar of silence)

Zen World - The Ultimate OTT Guide For Leads, Bass, and Master
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yzXtY2MLt0

OTT = Over the Top Compression

- Preset for Multiband Dynamics
- Mixing/Tone Shaping tool
  Upwards/Downwards Compressor:
- If volume goes below threshold, it is increased (Left bar = Upward Compression)
- If volume goes above threshold, it is decreased (Right bar = Downward Compression)
- Drag something to the right if you want it to increase ie. increase mid sounds
  Tips:
- Leave Time at 100%
- Make sure to know what you put behind OTT since it gets highlighted / as it compresses the crap out of it

Leads:

- Change depth from 0% up until it feels right (he goes to 33% - good combo of compressed / loud w/ uncomprossed+dynamics)
  --- Do the same for mids and lows bars (dragging to right)
  --- Reduce the lows far down (bass will fill the lows)

Bass:

- He applies it before the reverb
- Change depth from 0% up until it feels right (33% again)
- Add a little bit of hi/mid/low
  --- It is basically a compression + EQ this way

Master:

- Use it VERY sparingly on the master
- Upward 15%, Downward 21%, Depth 22%, Add a little bit of high/mid/lows

Zen World - 5 Effective Ways To Start A Song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afSM51BFk6E

1. Steal like an artist

- Other artists reference another artist (instead of some mystikal synth sound)

2. Start with a chord progression

- You don't even need to know how to write chords because you can use MIDI packs (Evo Sound
- You can use other's chord progressions (hooktheory.com) or (Unison MIDI Chord Pack)
- Another trick: Ableton trick w/ Chord + Minor/Major (Set Chord to 0/7/3 with Minor, 0/7/4 with Major)

3. Start with a vocal

- The hardest thing of starting a song is picking the Key/Chord Progression/Vibe/Theme/Genre
  --- Picking a vocal limits your options (in a good way)

4. Set Limitations

- Start with a genre/limitations and execute
- Know the genre/sub-genre you are in (will help with picking samples ie. Kick/Bass/Snare/etc.)
  --- You can still be unique within your own genre
  --- Need to know the rules before you break them!
- Once you get the theoretical stuff out of the way, you can start to be creative

5. Start with someone else's idea

- When you buy a sample pack, you are buying the taste of that designer

6. Name the song from the start

Chord Progression Notes
(http://www.piano-keyboard-guide.com/chords-by-key.html)
()

1. How to Make up a Chord for any Key

- Any chord is the 1st/3rd/5th of the 7 notes in a Key's Scale (ie. Scale C: C yes, D no, E yes, F no, G yes, A no, B no)
- First chord would be the key of the song (ie. Taylor Swift Love Story is D major, first key is D)

2. Major Keys Chord Pattern
   Pattern of chords for any major key: major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished

- ie. Using the key of C Major whose notes are C D E F G A B, the chords in the key of C major in order:
- C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, B diminished
  --- For instance, let’s start on the note C. The chord to play is C major and that’s obvious since the key is based on that chord.
  --- Let’s move to D. We can’t play D major because F# is not part of the scale and we can’t play D diminished either since this chord also makes use of flats (or black keys) that are not in the scale.
  --- The correct chord has to be D minor consisting of the notes D, F and A which are all part of the C major scale.

3. Minor Keys Chord Pattern
   Pattern of chords for any minor key: minor, diminished, major, minor, minor, major, major

- ie. Using the key of A minor whose notes are A B C D E F G, the chords in the key of A minor in order:
- A minor, B diminished, C major, D minor, E minor, F major and G major.
  --- Every chord makes use of notes that are part of the scale

4. Major chords vs. Minor Chords vs. Diminished Chords
   Major Chord = 1st-3rd-5th of the scale

- ie. for C major scale, 1st key is obviously C, so 'C-E-G'
  --- As mentioned above, the major chord is necessary for the 1st/4th/5th keys in a major scale
  --- Also mentioned above, the major chord is necessary for the 3rd/6th/7th keys in a minor scale
  Minor Chord = 1st-(flat 3rd)-5th of the scale
- ie. for C major scale, the scale's 2nd key is D, and the chord 'D-F#-A' is minored to 'D-F-A'
  --- As mentioned above, the minor chord is necessary for the 2nd/3rd/6th keys in a major scale
  --- Also mentioned above, the minor chord is necessary for the 1st/4th/5th keys in a minor scale
  Diminished Chord = 1st-(flat 3rd)-(flat 5th) of the scale
- ie. for C major scale, the scale's 7th key is B, and the chord 'B-D#-F#' is diminished to 'B-D-F'
  --- As mentioned above, the diminished chord is necessary for the 7th key (last key) in a major scale
  --- Also mentioned above, the diminished chord is necessary for the 2nd key in a minor scale

Full example:

Fireflies - Owl City:
BPM = 90
Key = D# Major

Keys in D# Major scale:

- D#, F, G, G#, A#, C, D
  Keys/Chords in D# Major scale:
- D# major, F minor, G minor, G# major, A# major, C minor, D diminished
  Keys in each chord:
- D# major: D#, G, A#
- F minor: F-G#-C
- G minor: G-A#-D
- G# major: G#-C-D#
- A# major: A#-D-F
- C minor: C-D#-G
- D diminished: D-F-G#

Keys in (hypothetical) D# Minor scale:

- D#, F, G, G#, A#, C, D
  Keys/Chords in D# Minor scale:
- D# minor, F diminished, G major, G# minor, A# minor, C major, D major
  Keys in each chord:
- D# minor: D#, F#, A#
- F diminished: F-G#-B
- G major: G-B-D
- G# minor: G#-B-D#
- A# minor: A#-C#-F
- C major: C-E-G
- D major: D-F#-A

Zen World - How Avicii Made His Melodies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXJp4pSoe7w

Cool trick that he saw in Avicii's video

- We are creating stable melodies / tonalities
  --- although it is predictable/boring, it sounds good in Dance music)

1st Chord Progression [2:08]

- Stable tone = Part of the chord / harmonic triad
- Here he has a D# chord, which has D#-F#-A#
- D# is on octave 1, the next 2 notes are higher up at octave 2
- Advice: Start on F# or A# for the melody above the chords
  --- The melody is on Octave 3
- At 1.3 when the chords change to a C# Major chord, our melody is going to want to be one of C#-F-G#
  --- Again, not everything has to be stable, but they should be for transitions (otherwise go crazy)

Sound Design Basics - Zendlo
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/sound-design-basics-zendlo/lectures/44945223

Intro to Synths

- His favorite Synth is Massive (he is 31)
- You can do the same stuff in Serum
  What a synth does:
- You play a note
- It generates a basic waveform
- It goes through LFO and ASDR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release)
- That goes into something that amplifies your sound
  LFO vs. ADSR:
- LFO = Repetitive
- ADSR = 1 time thing
  ADSR:
- Attack (time): How fast do we want the volume to get to 100% Velocity
- Decay (time): How fast do we want the volume to get down from 100% Volume to Sustain Volume
- Sustain (volume): How loud do we want the volume to get down to after decay
- Release: (time): How fast do we want the volume to get from Sustain dB to 0% (When letting go of the key)
  Example: Plucks
- We want it to get to peak volume fast (Low attack)
- We want it to go back down really fast (Fast decay - but not too fast that we cannot hear it)
- We want it to go back down to 0% (Low Sustain)
  LFO:
- Repetitive at whatever rate you set it to (When automating, goes back and forth, and back and forth)
  Amplify your sound:
- Yes, synths are cool because they have a really good tone to them (That's why Korg's are so expensive)
  --- Good oscilators / filter
  --- Beyonve has much better filters, oscilators than we do
- Professional Synths have a lot of movement

Syntorial

- High recommendation for learning sound design
- Shows difference between 4 basics: square, sawtooth, sine, triangle

Digital vs. Analog

- Serum FX is a plugin that can be applied to other Instruments / vocals / etc.
- You don't need to know all about synths
  --- You need presets, and know how to manipulate them
- Spend time on your synth lead if it's the feature
  --- If it is just a pad in the back, use presets
  --- Omnisphere is the king for Pads, Diva is very nice
  --- If you have to get synths use Serum, very safe bet

Layering Audio

- You can sound design with anything, he takes a clap and shapes it to make it thicker
- Shows example of heartbeat
  --- All you need is a source sound and to design it after

FX & Resampling

- Talks about wall of sounds ie. layering a bunch of synths/really anything
- Once you get something to sound how you want it to, now to Reverb/Delay/Distortion/etc.
- He likes using chorus (Quick delay, makes things wider)
- Reverb is a "space"
  --- "Oh" sample repeating with plugin fabfilter ProR
  ----- No more than 2-10% if you're just enhancing a vocal
  ----- 30ish% if it is something he wants really wet
  ----- When he tightens up the space it still sounds better than dry
- I like this: For a short tail that sounds wet, Freeze track trick
  --- Freeze track -> Flatten Track -> Extend the clip out [6:50]
  --- Taking the end of a frozen section and reversing it is a good uplifter
  (freeze and flattening is one of the most powerful tools in sound design)
- I like this: Shifter -> Automate pitch course
  --- Could be useful for buildups, especially with added reverb
- Delays: automate feedback for delay throws
  --- It is for delaying the last word into the distance
  How to:
- Take the last word that you want thrown
- Turn on automation to 100% for channel 'B Delay'
- Add Feedback + Dry/Wet in the channel

Project File Management

EQ

- Use EQ as a filter to make things sound darker as needed

Zen World - HOW TO EQ YOUR BASS PROPERLY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNnopAGVSaM

Some people combat muddiness by boosting things

- We want to keep each sound in its own lane so that they don't fight

1st Example
Steps he is taking:

1. EQ the bass w/ a low pass
2. See where the kick is hitting + Duck the bass down at that frequency

- When you take away a sound, you also need to add something back (Additive EQ'ing)

3. Add back to the base

- Put a Spectrum on the base
- Find the frequency you ducked down (ie. 54 Hz)
- If 54 Hz is at A0, go find A1 and bring the EQ up a bit there to compensate
  --- Make the Q high on this so it is only boosting up where we want it to

2nd Example

Sub:

- Utility with Bass Mono
- EQ and put the '8' at 79 Hz 0.78 Q

Bass 1 (Mids):

- Get rid of lows '1' x4 95 Hz 0.66 Q
- Right click and enable oversampling

Bass 2 (Highs):

- Get rid of low and mids '1' at 900 Hz 0.78 Q

Dealing with muddiness between Bass 1/2

- It is coming from the mids
- Put '3' at Gain 13.3 dB and 0.93 Q and look around for the mud
  --- Turn headphones on in top right and find clickiness/bad sounds
- '3' ends up being 161 Hz -4.83 Gain 1.79 Q

After using the Saturator, he puts on another EQ w/ Oversampling

- A saturator can introduce new/unwanted frequencies

3rd Example

- Watch from 10 minutes on if you want

Westend - 3 Tracks in an hour
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/enrolled/1992926

Track 1 - Starts out with drums

- I like how he uses a synth w/ arpeggiator as the fill
  --- 1/16 rate, 99% gate
- Double kicks and Reverse kick at end of 8 bar
- Synth loop for the 2nd 8 bars
- 16 bar Buildup: Synth with automations
  --- Endless smile
  --- Pitch U up 12 semitones, Pitch D down 12 semitones, Pitch bend automate from -12 to 12
  --- LFO Tool mapped to coarse pitch [18:25]

Track 2 - Starts out with vocal

- Reese Space (Basic Reese) sounds really cool
- Stutter on lead sound with arpeggiator [11:20]
- Adds filtering to vocal to reduce repetitivity
- Kick is introduced with low end gone, automate filter from 200 Hz to 100 Hz in 8 bar
- Adding a 2nd pad w/ chords (gradually) is very cool [14:48]
- Really cool snare roll: TK_MK4_SNARE_ROLL_WAYUP_126
- Come back to me is getting really annoying so might go towards a Melodic beat
  --- No vocal at the drop
  --- Techno bass: 16th notes to add to the already existing bass

Track 3 - Starts out with blank slate

- Decices on garage sound with 'Here for you' vocal
- I like how he picks the 'B' side of the drop for call and response
  --- Can use a synth in this situation
- Great idea: Filter down vocal between bar 16-17, airhorn sound and drop beat at 17 [16:45]

How CID Creates Driving Tech House | In The Dojo #6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMyPEExE_oI

Kick + Bass

- 3 different kicks, is not perfect
  --- wants the click from 1 of them
- Bass has a long chain of plugins
  --- Sidechain 1: Kickstart Extreme Short 100% to keep bass away from transient of kick
  --- Sidechain 2: Only 83Hz and below, to hear some mids but not have it fight with kick

Drums

- For some loops he EQ's out everything but the very top, for example
  --- "I didn't want to take up space but I wanted the movement
- Drum Buss: puts on entire bus, 12% Soft Drive, Crunch 5.6%, Damp 20 kHz, Transients 0, Freq 50, Decay 100, Dry/Wet 5%

Gain Staging - Ky William
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/gain-staging-ky-william/lectures/45193027

Intro
"When I learned how to gain stage properly, is when I started to hear a difference in my music"

Leveling Out The Mix

1. Leveling it out

- Kick at -12
- Tip: Level things out in the same order every time
- Note: Dial levels up too high, then too low, then find sweet spot
- He wants to leave 6 dB headroom for the mixing engineer
- Note: Be conscious of avoiding phasing when stacking similar layers
  --- ie. 4 shakers layers, may want to EQ things
- Don't feel like levels need to be perfect - Compression will assist in next step

Compression, EQ, Saturation

- Saturation: Increases "perceived loudness", but not the volume/gain of that channel
  --- Saves headroom
  --- ex: uses it on bongos because they are velocity driven, hard to keep gain throughout track
  --- Look at his levels for saturation + compression [1:36]
- Tip: Look into using a widener to free up space for in your mids
  --- Remember in John Summit's videos where he talks about what is in middle/what is in sides
- Tip: Compressing vocals is very important in order to make them sound more consistent
- Decapitor: When on drum buss, A/B test until you CANNOT hear a difference
  --- Drum Fattener 1, Dry/wet at 100%, Output knob is being lowered until perfect

Ducking Your Breakdowns

- He starts by putting on an EQ to take out the bottom 100 Hz and Utility -2 dB gain
- At the end of 4 bars, the EQ turns off and Gain goes back to 0
  --- You can do this by having 0 -> -2 -> 0 (slanted), or -2 -> -2 -> 0 (straight)

How To Keep Your Track More Interesting - Sandor
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/how-to-keep-your-track-more-interesting-sandor/lectures/45157948

'What Nonsense' Perc Breakdown

- Rule in tech house: Add a new element every 8 bars
- Added an extra layer to clap (to fill in more space/add energy)
- Adds ride in at 65
  --- He talks about these in feedbacks a lot since they are so easy to add (sits in the background, high frequency)
- Offbeat snare from 73-81, 113-129
  --- Uses the 3ms delay feature on the right side of volume to add swing
  --- All of the interest in this track is adding new elements
  --- Not FX or Synths

'Shut Up' on Solotoko

- He mentions again how important rides are to making his tracks better
- If ride happens in mid breakdown, it must happen at last drop too
  --- Introduce something else new 8 bars after that drop, not the ride
  --- Maybe an extra shaker

Drums Of Steel

- He introduces an extra pad
  --- It is glowing, adding noise in the background
  --- Basic Serum pad in key w/ Filter, Reverb, Sidechain

Switch It Up

- Drop variation
  --- This track has a huge synth lead
  --- He adds a big downlifter that 1 bar after the 2nd drop, not in the 1st drop

'Wish For'

- 1st breakdown keeps the clap, 2nd breakdown keeps the hi hat
  --- It is useful to have 1 drum element in the breakdown to keep energy high
  --- Take away as much as you can, when they come back in the listener hasn't heard it in a while

Break Variation on 'Heartbeat' on Solotoko

- Song has 3 breakdowns
- 1: Vocal
- 2: Vocal, Vocal echo
- 3: Vocal, Vocal echo, Snare roll
  --- Use lower volume + Echoboy on the vocal echo
  ----- He also automates the volume of the echo up throughout the breakdown
  --- He likes adding a snare roll to all main breaks
  ----- Especially if there are no drums/bass
  --- Tips on snare roll: Automate volume up, Put it in Mono, Chop up the last bar to be faster
  ----- Mono helps because the stereo explosion at the drop will be bigger

Final takeaways:

- He uses a lot of EQ'ing of 'harsh frequencies' which are usually higher up in the mix

Laidback Luke - 30 Years of Producing: My 10 Biggest Mistakes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_tvDe_oBAo

10. Producing music at too loud of a volume

- Turn it down

9. Making music only for me

- 50% for people, 50% for me

8. Stuck in my ways for a decade
9. Thinking that it is all about the master chain (not the mix)
10. Not being able to produce on the road
11. Not knowing the real goal of producing

- Making something out of nothing

4. Not having the right kick drum
5. Not working in concepts

- Have a plan when you go to the studio

2. Having too long of sessions
1. Giving up

- He didn't give up, but thought about it 7-8 times
  Bonus: Studio vs. Hearing it Out
- Not the car test, like an actual show
- Things become more clear hearing it on the dance floor

Millean - Songwriting
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/songwriting-with-millean/lectures/42072796

Getting Started

- Hardly ever started from scratch (Hard to open up a blank Ableton)
- First tip: Start with an acapella, a version of another song
- He networks with a lot of people on Instagram
  --- Lots of hidden gem singers
- Lee Foss will put an EQ on lows w/ Auto Filter to try and make bass/synths

Creating a Pallete of Sounds Based on an Acapella

- Idea: Listen to only Kick/Bass/Acapella to see if it is nice
- One things he does is duplicating the channel if he hears something he likes
  --- ie. finds a cool synth and then looks for others

Filling out the Gaps

- Many tracks are not full, even after adding the drums
- In the silence after acapella, fill up the gaps with synths
- "When something stop playing, something else starts playing"
- Note: This helps make the song more interesting for non-tech house fanatics

Accentuating Existing Sounds

- After you fill the gaps, you want to try and highlight certain parts
  --- Make them more prominent in the track
  --- Layer sounds in some notes, but not in others
  --- Example: Little synth/hit, does a d-d (2 hits) and 2 bars later does d (1 hit)

Creating Progression in the Arrangement

- You should try and change something every 4-8 bars
  --- Reverse synths will help make things progress
  --- "You can feel that we are going somewhere"
- A/B sections in the drop

Breaking the Bass

- After 16 bars of drop, there is the breakdown section (Take out the bass!)
  --- Hates when he gets demos where the bass doesn't change
  --- Taking out the bass / changing the pattern can make the song feel so much more like a song
  --- "Too much of the same thing is a bad thing"
- Taking out the bass in the intro
- You can have multiple bass's (Bass reece, Bass growl)

Keep It Simple

- Hans synth / brass synth / big chords at the last drop

Building Out of a Loop

- It is nice to have a little box that you can throw shit in (w/o worrying about arrangement)
- Open up a loop and add a bunch of elements
  --- Vocal chops with delay
  --- Pads

---

FOMO - "Mercy" Full Track Breakdown + Free Ableton Project File
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAGSa_vflZk&t=250s

2 Band Sidechain

- Used for example with vocals where you do not want the highs sidechained as much as the lows

Notes:

- Especially in the high end, you don't always need to cut it off, can lower/shelve it with an EQ
- Use reverbs to drown out/turn things into more of atmosphere (creates space in the mix)
- Making your own uplifters in Serum is almost always better
- They master as you go so that you don't even need to use the master rack

Front To Back Track Breakdown - FOMO
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/front-to-back-track-breakdown-fomo/lectures/45518495

Intro

-

The Drums

- Fabfilter Pro (Clipping BM) to push drums as loud as possible without clipping
- Watch the video because there is a shit ton of stuff going on there that Idk about

The Bass

- 808 is in D# the entire time
  --- 2 Saturators with 0 drive and Soft Clip (it sounds good most of the time)
- 2nd layer of 808 in Drop 1b/2b to add to the mids
- Bass Buss has Glue Compressor with .01 attack/release to tame any peaks (Doesn't do much but act like a limiter)

Synths

- Bass sample on down beat (In key of the 808)
  --- Sounds like a bass house 'Wubbb'

Vocals

- Uses a bunch of settings/samples to make it sounds like a crowd of people is saying something

FX & Buildup

- Vocal rises by sampling a small bit and using an Arpegiator
- Automating the pitch bend of saw wave up
- Operator for white noise
- Automating auto filter down at the end for a super quick 'Zip' that allows the vocal to come in

Master

- Utility mapped to Keyboard's 3 to listen in Mono while mixing
- Glue Compressor
- FabFilter Saturn's Magic Miastering preset
- Enhance for high end
- EQ the highs down to balance out the mix
- FabFilter Pro L-2 to push gain/limit for loudness
- Utility to automate loudness down before the drop to increase impact at the drop
  (Volume slants down and goes back up at the drop)

How to Send Demos to Record Labels (Even if you have NO followers!)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbXWHgo_EHY

1. Getting your music ready

- Get at least 8-10 songs ready
- Get it mastered
  --- Pre master vs. Master?

2. Finding the right label

- Go down the rabbit hole on Beatport to look for labels who will sign/release new artists
- Top labels need you to have a following before they will touch you

3. The Arts Blueprint

- Send track to labels and wait 2 weeks for a reply (4 weeks for big label)
- Send a brand new Soundcloud Pro link, a private link specialized for this label only
- DO NOT attach an .mp3 / .wav to the email
- Example:

Basic email template:

Hello label owner,

Please could you check out my demo for your label!

Link:

Please excuse me, my English is poor...

Thanks
YOUR NAME

5. The Nudge

- Did you get my email?
- If they don't reply, they don't know your name enough to be on their radar!
  --- Use leverage of past labels to talk to bigger labels

Gate Sidechain - Zendlo
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/gate-sidechain-zendlo/lectures/45755754

What is a Gate:
Goal: Eliminate noise under a certain threshold.
(When signal passes a threshold, it opens up)

- Ex: A drummer has a tom mic, mic only turns on and records the tom stick if it reaches a certain dB
- Good for cleaning up drums/transient/noise of vocals

Threshold: The minimum level of dB we will be able to hear.
Return:

- The envelope of the gate
  Attack:
- Slower = smoother sound
  Hold: How much it holds the sound away in the middle
- Release:
- Floor: How deeply is it going to cut it
- 0 dB sounds natural, lots of gain reduction at -50 dB

Sidechaining with Gate: Sound plays normal when Kick plays, none otherwise
Sidechaining with Gate: Sound plays quiet when Kick plays, full otherwise

## Gate & Creativity:

Make & Mix Your Own Vocals - Millean.
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/make-mix-your-own-vocals-millean/lectures/45561571

Intro

- For most people it is very possible to do vocals all by yourself
- He prefers female voices usually, though

Recording the Vocal

- Using resampling, he pitches the entire beat up 4 semitones
- then records his vocal, then pitches vocal back down

Shaping The Buildup & Drop

- Note: I really like this 16 bar buildup
- WeDamnz type trick: At the end of the 8th bar of the drop, he makes 4 claps instead of the 1 [7:56]
  --- ie. there are 4 claps between 44.4 and 45.1
  --- He has a clap of 3 layers, only uses layers 2 and 3 for this quadruple effect

Adding Atmos & Tying it all Together

- He adds a reese bass at F1 (in key) with -8 volume during the 14 bar snare roll
- Another Diva Preset at F1 at beginning of 14 bars to serve as a crash/impact
- In 2nd drop, adding in Synth chords/melody as well as Pads can be cool
- Echo with Ping Pong on is a very cool delay

Closing Thoughts

- A good way to stand out is by using your own vocals

---

Westend - Ear Candy
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/ear-candy-westend/lectures/46174556

Intro

- Going through reference tracks, focusing on drops
- Taking away something like a kick can also be a type of ear candy

Percussion Ear Candy

- Looking for small additions to marginally improve the track
- Reverse clap (kind of as an uplifter before the clap)
- Automating anything you can think of every 4 claps or so (He uses corpus, can also do pitch/reverb/delay/etc.)
- Clap fills are cool
- Throwing in 1 hit hi hats/rides and panning hard left/right
- I like talking out the drums at beginning of 8 bar loop for 1/4 bar (or take out kick+bass)

Vocal Ear Candy

- It is boring to always have the ear candy after the 2/4/6/8
- End/Beginning of 8 bar chant with 1/4 ping pong delay
  --- Combine with removing the kick+bass or drums

Synth Ear Candy

- synths are usually additive (introducing a new sound that spices up your track/add freshness 'like lemon')
  --- Make sure to be in key + match up w/ the vibee
- Be very experimental with this stuff
  --- Could even use a bass sound as the synth candy
- Synths stabs on the 1 (westend told john summit to do this in movin' all around remix)
  --- Having a synth fill in the last bar, and then a stabb on 1, I love
- Octave jumps with 1/all notes is interesting too
- Make sure to do random automations with the macros in Serum

Final Thoughts

- Will oftentimes finish up a group and its ear candy before moving on
- Try wild stuff like a huge kick roll

Piero Pirupa - Track From Scratch
https://faderpro.com/programs/piero-pirupa-track-from-scratch

1. Drums

- Kick: KickTweak
- Claps and hats: He uses a chain of Drum Buss / EQ Eight out the lows and bring up the highs
- Drum top loops: Sidechain on his Drum top loops, also cuts lows and lowers down high frequencies w/ EQ
- Sidechain and EQ out lows/mids on ride, lower down volume too

2. Percussion

- Rim Percussion loops every 2 bars as a fill, remove low ends w/ EQ
- Adds part of a Snare riser as a fill every 2 bars, remove low ends + apply Overdrive + EQ Boost highs

3. Bassline

- He is kinda just playing with his keyboard and going through Serum presets
  --- He solo's the kick+bass to make sure they work together
- Kickstart for Sidechain
- Overdrive/Auto Filter/RBass by Waves/EQ to bring mids up
- He plays around with an EQ to see if he needs to change anything

4. Synths
   Lead

- He likes short reverb
- Cut out the low end / add kickstart
- Ends up stealing MIDI from bass line
  Pad
- Says he will use it for the break
- Similar MIDI to the bass line
  Atmosphere Pad
- Does 1 note in key for the entire time
- EQ out lows and highs

5. Vocals

- Uses CLA Vocals (Waves) with basic EQ of lows
- Sidechain
  Vocal cuts/chops
- Uses the 'loop' feature in the acapella sample to test out different loops (kick is playing in background)
  Takeaway
- Vocal
- Vocal rhythm loop
- 1 voice for fills
- 1 more voice at different tone/pitch

6. Arrangement

- Filtering the pad up, then down at very end of buildup
- Cutting lead synth MIDI in half on drop (only 1 loop instead of 2), will use fill MIDI later

7. Main Break

Give It To Me Track Breakdown - Kormak [Repopulate Mars]
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/give-it-to-me-track-breakdown-kormak/lectures/46397916

Kick

- Short kick
- Utility to put it in Mono
- EQ out bottom 20 (he says 30-40 for many kicks, try it free up space by finding Hz where sound is same)
- Muddiness range: usually occurs in Hz range 300-1000 so he ducked down kick with an EQ
  --- Surgical EQ'ing: High Q (precise, good for bringing down pockets)
  --- Boosting EQ'ing: Low Q (not preicse, good for bringing up an entire range, surrounding frequences compliment)
- Instead of using transient shaper, boosted highs with a shelf EQ
- Tuner to make sure we are in Key
- He does not use a compressor because the kick waveforms are already pretty level

Bass

- Uses Ableton's Operator with a G Major key
- Make sure to keep Bass in lockstep with Kick
- Mixing Chain:
- Keeps bass in Mono w/ Utility
- EQ to keep in low end < 200
- Compressor w/ Threshold -9 dB
- Compressor w/ Sidechain to Ghost Kick
- Limiter at -10.7 dB

Drums

- Bit reduction on claps (more human sound)
- Free up space with EQ on very top highs of Hats
- Mixing Chain:
- Decapitator
- OTT at 10% (good touch for atmospheric vibe on a group)
- EQ x2 (shelf to move up high, surgical eq to remove peaks that hurt my ears)
- Glue Compressor (goal is that it sounds good before, so that the lever only goes up to 2-3)
- ClassicClipper (saves a TON of headroom)
  --- Max RMS, Min Peak
- Automate reverb/auto filter when drums open up ie. fills

Synths
Arp

- Analog plugin
- Uses Wider (Infected Mushroom) can't speak higher enough about it
  Sounds 1/2
- Wider
- Valhalla

Takeaways

- He likes adding elements to his songs to make it sound realistic/live instruments
  --- Out of key, Heavy saturation, Bit reduction, 'mess up the sounds'
  --- Subtle touch!

Fisher's "You Little Beauty" Arrangement Breakdown - Sandor
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FciPkxwSxc

You Little Beauty and Heartbeat

- Both have Intro/16 Breakdown/16 Drop/16 Breakdown/16 Drop/32 Breakdown/16 Drop/Outro
- This gives more time to show off the synth work etc. in the drop
- Breakdown has no bass
- Create variety by new elements / changing beat of elements in 2nd/3rd breakdown

Touché Track Breakdown - Ky William

Kick and Bass

- Uses an 808 as the bass, it his when the Kick does not

Drums

- Shaker uses 'Total Random' with LFO's routed to the Decay and the Start
- Uses a shaker as a open hat
  --- Advice: Use elements in diff sounds ie. closed hi hat as shaker

Vinyl Crackle

- Can make a huge difference
- His is setup like this: 4 layers of -20 volume-ish
  --- Saturator/EQ lows/Sidechain+Compression

Vocal, Guitar and Synths

- Vocal: remember that a lot of vocals already have processing done on them
- Guitar: Width, Reverb, Fresh Air, Sidechain, Soundtoys 'Radiator'
- String: Chorus, Reverb,
- FM Stab: EQ low, Compressor for Sidechain, Wider

Choosing Better Drum Samples - Westend
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/sample-selections-westend/lectures/46681198

Intro

- Only way you can train your brain on sample selection is active listening
  --- ie. WHY something sounds the way it does
- Usually this comes up with drums because 1,000,000 samples

Referencing
Matroda, Saturday Love

- Tight/Punchy/Short/Crisp sound
  --- Digital sounding, clear
  "What was the intention here?"
  Ferrick Dawn
- Longer hats

Selecting your Kick Drum

- More difficult, low end Relationship with kick and bass is complicated
  --- More than just the vibe
- Be conscious of the key
  --- Kick can be out of key, but
  --- Lower key of kick drum = Darker sound

Video Takeaways:

- Rule: Get 75% to where you want to be with the sample dry

"Wish For" Track Breakdown - Sandor

Kick

- You don't want to limit your kick, unless it is a top/mid layer
  --- you don't want to squash the low-end punch at all!

Bass

- 2 layers in Serum
- RBass to beef up the low-end
- 3ms delay on the bass to

Drums

- 36% Wider on the entire drums group
- UAD Pultec to
- Hat reverb is very important for filling out the mix

FX

-

Vocal/Transitions

-

Atmos/Extra Details

- 'Foley' with Haas Effect (Delay) and Limiter
  --- Limiter squashes it so it Adds a solid sound that adds character

Drop Synth

- Arpeggiator

Call & Response - Millean.
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/call-response-millean/lectures/46846356

Intro

- It is a vague term, but basically is just the music talking back and forth with each other
- Motif = a decorative design or pattern
  --- My thoughts: a lot of sounds playing the same notes

Working w/ MIDI

- Multiple sounds to make our motif interesting
- Grabs a Grand Piano to help us start jamming out
  --- My first thoughts is to use Grand Piano with Sting!64 or another AI Midi Generator
  Steps:

1. Make a bunch of different MIDI Motifs in Grand Piano

- Always remember you can do TWINSICK and drop one down 1 octave

2. Try them out with other sounds/instruments

- You can split up the individual MIDI's among different instruments
- Put pitch on each so that you don't have to go into the MIDI clip for lower instruments ie. bass lines
  Notes:
- Delay is effective on Synths that hit 1st beat

Working w/ Audio

- Once again, starts with a piano MIDI beat
  --- He eventually turns it off (to focus on how the synths sound)
- He is dragging in random synth 1 shots
  --- Lots of processing on them ie. echo/hall reverb
  --- Use the piano MIDI as a guide for where to put them
  Notes:
- Add sounds that are the same key, just different sounds ie. different G# Synth on 2nd bar
- Sometimes he makes 20 sounds and only keeps 2
  --- Only keep the best!

---

Tricks to Stay Creative - Ky William

Akaizer

- Sample Stretching Program
- Not a VST, unfortunately

Simpler

- He drags in a Piano sample
- Change mode to 'Slice' instead of 'Classic/1-Shot'
  --- 1. Play it
  --- 2. Sting64 (or any sequencer)
  --- 3. LFO (map the LFO to the density)
- Recommends to try this out with Vocal Chops

Play Phrase: playphrase.me

- When he gets bored of samples, starts doing this to get movie quotes
- Type in "Hey how are you" and the database searches for that quote in movies
- What he likes to do is use a random quote generator (here is one: https://miniwebtool.com/random-quote-generator/)
  --- after finding cool quote, copy/paste that into playphrase.me

Lodopemine.com

- Click shuffle and it comes up with

Songwriting - Starya
https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/songwriting-starya/lectures/43992222

Overview

- Journey as producer started WAY after journing as songwriting
- "You can have a song, but not have a track"
- Good to use the Beauty of randomness but with Structure / Restrictions
- Limit yourself to 1 thing at a time

Starting A New Track

- Likes to start out with chord progressions
  --- This is where knowing an instrument comes handy!
  Chord Progressions
- Open Ableton Grand Piano
- Before jamming, get into E flat or G# (this is where the sub sounds the best!!)
  --- She settles on F (minor I believe)
  --- Choosing a key is good because you can do whatever you want, BUT are restricted to that key (Randomness+Structure)
- chordchord.com is great for idea generation
- Throw on an arpegiator to make it sound more interesting immediately

FOMO - "Hey. Mr DJ" Full Track Breakdown + Free Ableton Project File
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jaaF1yZ6Jw

Drums

- Uses panning automation on fills and clap fills
- Add white noise to everything ie. white noise as a hi hat
  --- White noise is pleasing to the ears

Effects

- White noise and exhaust in drop
  --- Use reverses into another drop
  --- Pan automation of

Bass

- Only uses FabFilter Pro-L 2 so that nothing clips out of the group channel
- Uses Macro 1 to open filter up for fills at end of phrases
- Uses Macro 2 to pop up the resonance every couple hits
  --- Opening up filter and resonance extra for 8 bar fills is cool
- Haas delay for stereo width
- Bass 2 for buildups and chorus is just less 'blasted'

Drop Group

- Throwing stuff/sounds at the wall to see what sticks
  --- When writing a song, you want to make something you have never heard of before!
- Uses the 2band sidechain (
- Shift-Option trick when trying to put synths in the drop
  --- Warp it and everything, then try diff parts of the loop
  --- Put it where you want the sound, even tho you don't know which noise you want yet
- Reverb throws
  --- Automate their 'Reverb Thrower' rack from 0 to 127

Break Group

- Filling out the mix with sounds in key:
  --- High string
  --- Vinyl
  --- White noise
  --- Chimes
- LFO type sound for 'Synth flutter'
  --- Sort of like a lead synth for the last 8 bars of the 16 bar break

FX

- Rising Saws that lead into each other
  --- He has a 16 bar Saw that leads into a 4 bar saw
  ----- the 2nd 8 bars of the 16 bar saw have another rumble / low noise added for suspense
- Lots of KSHMR sweeps and impacts/drops
  Takeaway Advice for FX:
- Always have effects lead into each other
- some downward and upwards motion to make the track flow

Vocals

- 'Enhance' rack preset to add white noise (makes it more pleasing to the ear)

Mastering

- Gain goes down during buildup
- Washout goes up during buildup
- Fabfilter to make sure we don't clip out of the master

Here is the beginning of the bottom.

---

Syntorial

Bass: low cutoff, zero attack
Lead: bright, zero attack
Pad: soft attack, long release, low cutoff

Doubling and transposing: Playing 2 different oscilators

- Common settings:
- Osc A: ; Osc B +12/24/36 (1 Octave = 12 Semitones)
- Osc A: ; Osc B +7/19/31 (1 Fifth = 7 Semitones)

Filter Knob:
Least bright is decided by Cutoff Knob
Most bright is decided by Envelope Amount Knob (distance between
When programming the filter envelope:

- if you change the cutoff knob, you probably have to change the envelope amount knob

Example: Low filter knob + High envelope: Filtered sound that gets to full loudness eventually
(there is a lot of distance between the low filter and high envelope knob)

Filter envelope attack: Chooses how fast the 'brightening' occurs

- Horn: Fast attack

Steps for this:

1. Cutoff to darkest point (Lower cutoffs give a fatter horn effect)
2. Envelope Knob to brightest point
3. Set the attack's speed

Doubling and Detuning

- 100 cents = 1 semitone
- Pulsating effect is fast at Osc 1 +9, Osc 2 -9, really fast at Osc 1 +30, Osc 2 -30
  --- Make sure they are the same number to stay in tune
  --- Exception: Osc 1 +0, Osc 2 -1, you get a slow flanging effect
- Oscilator Start Button: On = Pointy Attack Transient w/ Consistent Pulsation, Off = Softer Rounder Attack Transient w/ Varying Pulsation
- Note: Don't double/detune bass's much, they are supposed to be supporting

LFO

- Repeating Movement

Filter Resonance

- Boosts your sound near its brightest point (which is determined by the cutoff knob)
- Can tighten/focus/add 'point' to our sound
- Ringing sound if you turn resonance all the way up
- Really starts to shine when used with the filter envelope

Mono + Poly Voice Modes

- Note: Voice = Played note
  Mono: Can only play 1 voice at a time
- "Forces single note playing, which can be important for bass lines and leads"
- The 2nd note played will steal the first note's sound
  --- If you let go of Note 2, Note 1 will keep playing if it is pressed down
  Poly: Can play 2+ voices at a time
- Good for playing multiple notes with long release, so that they don't cut each other off
- Note: If you play 2 notes at once and their release is playing, need 4 voices total to hear 2 more notes

Unison

- Great way to get a big sound
- Take volume down because unison on makes things much louder
  --- It is basically doubling/detuning but magnified
- Default 2 voices: Doubles our oscilators (4 = Quadruple)
- Note: Oscilator 'Start' adds an attack transient
  --- More noticeable with the 4 voices
  Unison Detune
- Increases/Decreases the pitch between each voice
  --- Similar to oscilator fine knobs
  Unison Spread
- Same as Detune on Serum
  --- Middle is the most popular for a big, all consuming sound

Reverb

- Puts a 'space' around your sound (sounds like it is being played in a room)
  --- It is getting farther and farther away
- Similar to delay, the Mix knob is going to lower volume and take a % of the dry
  --- Use return tracks in Ableton
  Reverb Size-
- Determines the size of the room ie. Church/Stadium/Canyon vs. Bedroom

Legato Voice Mode

- Mono: Monophonic, "1 note at a time"
- Legato: If you go from 1 note to the next, the envelopes do not start over at the attack stack (Connected)
- Creating transients with the filter envelope:
  --- Mono: Transient with every note (jumps from 0-top, then down to sustain)
  --- Legato: Not a transient with every note (connects from the current sustain level)

Portamento

- Bends each note's pitch to the next note's pitch
  --- 2nd note starts at 1st note, then pitch bends down to where it was clicked
  --- Sort of gives your sound 'attitude', which is why it is commonly used with leadsx

Portamento + Legato

- Mono: Portamento bends every time a new note is played
  --- Abrupt beginning
- Legato: Portamento bends ONLY when played in a legato fashion (overlapping/connected/blurred)
  --- Smoother portameno

Triangle Wave

- More quiet than saw/pulse (30/70 mix knob)
  --- "Rounder, softer"
  --- Can unfortunately add a 'click' sound on attack
- Mixing triangle with saw/pulse, it is easy to hear the difference
  --- Triangle=round, Saw=bright/edgy
- Mixing: 30/70 is not always what you do, nicer blend at 50/50
  --- Digital pop can happen, bump attack by .2
  --- Boost main volume due to reduction in volume
  Note: Lower cutoff can make it hard to know what the waveform are

Chorus

- Higher it goes up, more pulsation/widening
  Chorus Rate
- Speed of the pulsating effect
  --- Makes it more intense too

Types of Pulsation

- Doubling and Detuning (1 wave form down the middle) (Any waveform)
- Pulse Width Modulation (1 wave form down the middle) (Pulse only)
- Unison (Widening multiple oscilators) (Aggressive for leads/basses)
- Chorus (Widening multiple oscilators) (Softer/more subtle)

Mod Envelope (Modulation Envelope)

- Controls the LFO modulation speed
- You decide what part of the envelope the synth modulates
- Start by setting destination to pitch
- Amount: Determines how high the modulation goes during attack stack (Think height of triangle)

Oscilator Sync

- Grinds up your sound
  --- Saw=Thin/buzzy, Pulse=Metallic
- Osc 1 (Master) forces Osc 2 (Slave) to change its wave
  --- Osc 2's sound changes, making a grinding sound
  --- Higher semi settings increase separation
  --- Avoid octaves and 5ths bc no Sync
- You can ignore what Osc 1's waveform since Mix is 100% on Osc 2
- Most common way to use oscilator sync = With a mod envelope
  --- Move the pitch of oscilator 2 instead of the whole thing

High Pass Filter

- So far we have used low pass to make our sound darker
- High pass will cut the lows instead and make our sound thinner/brighter

Band Pass Filter

- Does low and high cut, leaves only the frequencies near your cutoff

Filter Types and Resonance

- Low Pass Resonance: Boost at TOP
- High Pass Resonance: Boost at BOTTOM
- Band Pass Resonance: Boost in the MIDDLE

FM (Frequency Modulation)

- Adds a metallic quality to your sound
- To do: Make waveforms are sine, Mix at 100% #1
  --- As you turn up the knob, there's less round/pure sine sound and more metallic edge
  --- Not as edgy as oscilator sync
  --- Can create a click when Amp Attack=0

FM Tuning

- Tuning up pitch of Osc 2 will intensify the FM and bring out the bell noise in higher settings
  --- Dissonance comes into play when not on a fifth/octave
  --- Semi knob at 0 is 1 note/sine wave, when knob goes up there is a 2nd sine wave

Sine Wave

- Round and Pure sound

FM Amount and Tuning

- Amount = Metallic FM edge
- Tuning = How high the pitch of the FM edge is

FM and Modulation Envelope

- Starts at current FM setting, attacks up, decays down, ends at current FM setting

Ableton Tips:

Transients Trick:

- Change the number (in a loop) from 100 down to a lower number
- It will make the transients shorter, therefore shorter and not as prominent in the mix

Put a loop around what you are working on

- Higlight the bar -> Ctrl-L

Change default BPM to 126

- Set your defaults -> Options -> Preferences -> File/Folder -> Save Current Set as Default

- Plugins I am considering:
- Ozone 10 / Full Masting Production Suite: https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/music-production-suite-5.html
- Trackspacer: https://www.pluginboutique.com/products/3259-Trackspacer?nosto=frontpage-nosto-1

Note when downloading KickTweak;

- It came in .dll, so I put it in a new folder 'VST2' right next to 'VST3' in
  C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST2
- Then went into Ableton preferences and set the VST2 location to there

https://soundcloud.com/myles_thomas/vol-1

Adding Voxengo MSED + Voxengo SPAN Plus:

- Downloaded both from website
- Did not see VST's in the folders
- Uninstall
- Install again, make sure to get VST
  (this will come in a .dll)
  Drag from here: C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST2\Voxengo
  To here:
  C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST2
- Finish by deleting Voxengo folder + Refreshing plugins in Ableton

- Add in 'MIDI Effects -> Scale' and drag in the Minor.adv (assuming we are in minor)
- Change the Key (Probably E or F)
- Add in Serum
- Name this track 'Sting64! Setup'

2. Make another empty MIDI Channel

- Change 'All Ins.' to the name of the first channel we made (Sting64! Setup)
- Hit Red Record Button
- Hit 'S' to Solo the Sting setup track
- Hit the Record circle at top of the screen next to play

3. Repeat #2 with the following settings if you are not happy with the pattern

- Go into Sting and change the density (More density = more notes)
- Add MIDI Effects -> Pitch and pitch it up and Octave (+12 st) if it's too low
- Hit the Smiley face on Sting to get a new pattern
- Changing 'Length' parameter from 16 to 8 makes it a shorter/more repetitive pattern

4. When you find one you like...

- Keep the record button on
- Duplicate the 2nd track with recorded MIDI
- For the new duplicated track, hit the Red Record Button so that input goes to there
- Repeat as many times as you would like

5. Finish up

- Turn off Sting/MIDI Effects/Pitch
- Take the pattern that you liked most and in the 1st MIDI Channel, duplicate it out

How to find a relative minor:
https://www.masterclass.com/articles/guide-to-relative-scales-in-music#2se0ShteNaezhB1sQgv6PQ

+You can find the relative minor of a major scale by finding
that scale's sixth scale degree—the sixth note in the scale.
For instance, the D major scale goes D-E-F♯-G-A-B-C♯.
The sixth scale degree is B.
Therefore, the relative minor of D major is the key of B minor.
In fact, you can create a B minor scale by simply starting a
D major scale on the note B.
You'll end up using all the same notes,
but you'll be playing in a different key."

v7 (F# Minor 7th) - F#-A-C#-E (note: they moved F# and A up an octave)
iv (E minor) - E-G-B (note: they use G# instead of G, see note below!)

## Tongue Tied vs. Love Story:

Music Theory notes:

Key:
twinsick: D# major
me: D major

twinsick 'saws':
IV – G#/Ab major seventh (Normal: G# - B# - D# - 7=G)
[Theirs: G# octave down - G# - B# - skip D# - G octave up]

(I think this is A flat Major 7th, with the 1-3-7 (omitting the 5th, doubling up on the bass of 1)
(Article talking about dominant 7th that skips the 5th and doubles the bass is confusing me but also cleared things up...)

- Current answer: A flat Major 7th, skipping 5th and double up on bass (G#)

ii – E#/F minor seventh (E# == F) (Normal: F - Ab - C - 7=Eb - 9=G)
[Theirs: F octave down - F - skip Ab - B#/C - skip Eb - G octave up]

- My current answer: F minor 9th where we omit the no3(Ab) and no7(Eb), double up on bass (F), move 9th up

vi – B#/C minor seventh (B# == C) (Normal: C - Eb - G - 7=Bb)
[Theirs: C octave down - G - C - skip Eb - G octave up]

- Current answer: idk

I – D#/Eb major seventh (Normal: Eb - G - Bb - 7=D)
[Theirs: Eb 1 octave down - Eb - G - Bb - Eb octave up - G octave up)

- Current answer: Regular Eb major chord, w/ extra notes below/above i

Frontier: I signed up for this Frontier card because of an in-flight offer that said I would get 60,000 free miles once I did 2 things: Pay my annual fee, and make 1 purchase with my card. I have done both - When will I receive my 60,000 miles bonus reward? Thank you for your help today.

Chase: I applied for the Chase Sapphire Reserve on 3/10/2023. I have a great credit score so figured I would be accepted immediately, but I still have not heard anything. It says sometimes you have to wait 7-10 business days, but it has been over a month so now I am just totally confused why I have not been given a decision. Can you help me figure out what is going on? I call the Chase line every Monday morning and it still says 'you will know in 7-10 business days'. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

## A DANCE TRACK IN 5 MINUTES…

Plugins: THE_INSTRUMENT

Synth:

- Key = C
- Chord mode on
- Synth > SY Newrave
- Rhythm: Basic Rhythm 1
- Shapes the decay/sustain/release ie. the envelope
- Bars 1-9 have low pass filter going from bottom to top

Duplicate the track to make an effect in Bar 8-9.

- ie. remove Bars 1-8 so that you only have the last bar
- Remove Bars 8-9 from the original synth

Effect:

- Put the release back up
- Activate the Stab by turning that all the way up

Bass for intro:

- Bass > Dance > BS REECES
- Same notes (of course)
- Change from chord mode to melody mode
- Tranpose 1 octave down (with the negative sign)
- Mono mode = ON (for glide effect)
- Bump up 1 semitone from C to C#
  - Uses the 'C' and 'P' in top left to paste the settings onto the other instance

Pluck:

- Pluck > PL HALL
- Tranpose up 1 octave
- Rhythm > Sequences > UPS AND DOWNS
  - He presses C not to see how they play in C#
- Press that 1 note the whole time
- Automate another low pass filter up in Bars 1-9
  - Duplicate it out for 9-17 without the auto filter

Bass for drop:

- Bass > BS ZONDERBASS
- Get rid of the melody ie. BASSLINES > SOME GAPS
- Midi: 1.1-4.3 C3, 4.1-4.5 A#2, 4.3-5.1 B2
  - Overlap the notes a bit so that the rhythm plays through!
- Shaper effect:
  - Sidechain ducking: Turn the shaper on

Drums:

- He uses samples from his pack with 4 to the floor kick pattern (easy)
  - I will most likely use drum sets from topmusicarts.com
-

More duplication for the 2nd half ie. Bars 9-17:

Lead:

- Lead > LD ISAWYOU
- C3 from Bars 13-17
- Pitch bend modulation
  - 0 up to 8000, then straight down to 0
  - Bars 1.4 to 2 UP, 2.4 to 3 DOWN

Buildup:

- Uses something from his drum pack

Stab:

- Search 'stab' > SY STARBY
- Chord mode:
- MIDI: On up beat ie. 1.1.3 and 3.1.
  - Also has 4 and 4.3

## HOW TO MAKE AN EDM TRACK IN 25 MINUTES

Plugins: THE_PATTERN, THE_INSTRUMENT, THE_LIQUID

Epic Chords:

- Synth >
- Key = F then D then A
- Chord mode ON
- Dance Chords > HANDSUP MINOR (Really big chords)
- Rhythm > Basic Rhythms > HITIT
  - Holds the notes
- Make the release shorter on ASDR
- Press record and get all 7 notes in the key
  - Make them overlap a bit

Idea: Automate to an octave up after 8

Duplicate the track and switch the sound to a house piano.

House piano:

- 1 octave lower

Stab then Pluck:

- PL HALL
- Remove lows with cutoff filter (Locut)
- Strum > Turn it all the way up

THE_PATTERN:

- Makes EDM drums with clap and snare 4 to the floor

THE_PATTERN:

- Adds 8 bars of kicks for the drop

Lead:

-

## PHIL SPEISER AD - REALLY COOL VOCAL CHOPS AND WHATNOT

[Link to my Vimeo recording](https://vimeo.com/843190397/3c4c36a436?share=copy)

Vocal:

- He has 16 bars of a vocal, which is the 8 bar build and 8 bar drop

THE_INSTRUMENT:

Pad:

- Select Key = D
- Chord mode = ON
- Chords > Dance chords > Nostalgia Major
- Sound > Pads > PD Basement
- Create the chord progression: (Watch video to get rhythm correct)
  - 1 bar: F
  - 1 bar: G
  - 1 bar: A
  - 1 bar: C
  - Duplicate it out so you have 8 bars of this ie. 4 bars \* 2

Duplicate track to make a melody.

Melody:

- Change from Chord to Melody mode
- Bass > BS REESETALK
- Keep the same notes

Vocal Chops:

- Open new audio track
- Copy parts of the vocal onto this track
- Shift up 12 semitones (1 octave)
- Add on THE_SHAPER
- PHIL'S presets > TECHHOUSE VOCAL CHOP
- SLICE MODE > Do the following:

  ![SLICE mode with THE_SHAPER](./figures/0.png)

- VERB MODE > Do the following:

  ![VERB mode with THE_SHAPER](./figures/1.png)

- Automate the vocal chops from with an low pass filter
- Copy the vocal chops so they are in the drop

Now, duplicate the chords from the Pad above so we can use those same chords for rhythmic piano chords.

Rhythmic Piano Chords:

- Keys > KY 90sPIANO
- The Rhythm > BASSLINE > DANCE
- Low pass filter automation
- THE_SHAPER for sidechain
  - Automate the sidechain to be on only in the drop
    - I just used kickstart for sidechain automation (turn off shaper)

Drums with THE_PATTERN:

- Fabric 123 BPM
- Drag in MIDI file > Remove Preview mode
- Remove kick and main hat from buildup
- Remove some drums before the drop

Note: I will probably use my own drums still...

Time to make a drop!

Drop Bass:

- Melody Mode
- Duplicate the Pad/Bass track
- Make notes half the length
- Choose a new bass sound ie. BASS > BASS DEEPDIVE
- THE_RHYTHM > BASSLINES > DANCE
- Make the MIDI notes overlap a bit
- Instant sidechain should be on with THE_SHAPER (I think)

Lead melody:

- Duplicate drop bass
- Remove MIDI
- Melody mode
- LEAD > LD RUSTYVOICE
- MIDI DATA
  - 1-2: C6
  - 2-3: B5 then E5
  - 3-4: C6
  - 4-5: B5 then E5 then
    - Make them overlap a bit

Note: I think THE_SHAPER of THE_INSTRUMENT is on still, but... still do the following...

- Add a brand new THE_SHAPER plugin > empty > Phils presets > 90S
- Duplicate lead to be in the buildup
  - Automate low pass filter up

### Zen World - How To Create Beautiful Arps For Progressive House

[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zz_0nOIJOQ)

Steps:

1. Create Chord Progression

- These determines where Arp melody goes

2. Find a Sound

- Leads are good

3. Create rhythm

- Generic on every note 1/16 works, but you can make a rhythm by removing notes

4. Overlay Chords over Arp Rhythm

- Click on chord midi > Ctrl > Click on arp midi

5. Use Note from Chords

- Most arp melodies will be stable (use all notes in key)
  - Don't be afraid to break that!

## Westend - Motivational Tips

### Full Tutorial

Motivation over 10+ year career that has helped make him a better artist

1. Make must production as comfortable as possible

- when you go to produce, you should be comfy

  - physically: get a nice vibe going

    - invest in your space
      - more time in front of computer = higher chance for success
        - ultra big monitor
        - nice chair
        - headphones/speakers
          - invest in this stuff before plugins

  - mentally:

2. Be organized

- treat it like the gym
- take notes and write down what your plan is going to be
  - find 1 hr slots

3. Steps outside of your comfort zone

- it is very easy to fall into habits
  - especially with house music
- good to focus on trying new things
  - arrangements
  - genres ie. happy/melodic/dubstep
- don't limit creativity because of external factors

4. Do not think about the label / end product while creating

- example: you want to get signed by chris lake's record and you try to make it sound like that
  - 1. you reference too hard
  - 2. you don't sound unique
- record labels want unique music

5. Do not compare yourself to others

- bad for mental health
- this is not a 0 sum game!
- only compare yourself to your past self
  - metrics ie. plays
  - quality of songs
  - goals set at beginning of year

6. Your sound CAN change!

- just because you have success in one sound, doesn't mean you cannot change
- nobody really cares
- everything is constantly changing
  - you are being stagnant if you do not get inspired by new sounds
- Eli Brown is an exapmle of changing sound and becoming way more popular

7. You should be excited to produce!

- it should never be a chore
  - if it sounds like a chore (has been for me many times), look up to 1-6 because that is probably one of the issues here
- try making fun remixes

## FOMO - Advanced Resampling

### Full Tutorial

Building out a library of unique sounding synths

Try to stay as organized as possible

- resampling folder
  - labeled by bass/synth/lead/etc.
    - key bpm (if applicable)

Tips for making these sounds

- automate as many things as possible
  - you want to make it hard to re-create

Process

1. Find serum preset you like
2. Make a rack that automates the things that make the sound cool
3. Turn off delay/reverb (these can make it messy)
4. Pitch bend to -12/12

Repeat!

## Alice Yalcin Efe - 4 Methods to Instantly Glue Kick and Bass

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVxIX2dBbP4)

Combination of Kick and Bass:
- Sounds separated
  - They have no common frequencies

### Theory: Time and Frequency Domain

Time domain: 

### Time separation & sidechain

### Full vs. Partial Separation

Full separation
- Kick hits
- No bass

Partial Separation
- Kick hits
- Sidechain the bass to the kick
  - There is some overlap (glue!)

### Old Skool

Using sidechain compressors
- boring...

### Pultec technique

Pultec:
- 

Steps:
- Group Kick and Bass together
- Use low end boost + attenuation
  - cut over until 100-400 hz has enough

### Alice's Pultec Method

Using an EQ curve
- shelf EQ at lowest hz
- bell down for 100-400

### The GPU Revolution

Ad: GPU Audio
- [Link](https://www.gpu.audio/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=video3@mercurialtones)

### The glue compression

Glue compressor: Brings everything closer together
- Threshold: Down 
- Makeup: up (5-6db)

### Alice's favorite glue compressor

COMP TUBE-STA

### Sub-smoothing

Sub-smoothing: Advanced version of glue compressing
- Useful when you have a few elements and bring the sub closer to each other
- Can apply to individual tracks, but you should use on a low end bus

### Bonus: The ultimate sauce

2 different ingredients

Steps:
1. Insert return track and named it 'Low end crush'
- Send low end bus at -6db 

2. Setup return track
- Distortion or Saturation
- Pultec at 60hz
- Ozone Advanced image

3. Adjust the amount
- Change the volume for the return track

4. Optional: Limiter
- You are adding noise/volume, so look into this before finishing up

## Alice Yalcin Efe - Shocking Truths About Bass and Your Brain

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0LEDijJ0cc)

### Something irrestistable

Why do we love bass so much?
- Finding this out was very cool/interesting, so stay tuned!

### It starts early

From 24-40 weeks, babies start to hear visually
- frequencies that make their way to a baby are the low/bass frequencies 

### The mother's natural filter

Above 250 Hz, it is filtered out by the mother's womb
- 9 months where all the baby does is listen to bass!
  - This imprints into your memory, the soothing comofrt

### Sometimes it is about danger / The adrenaline addiction

Humans have a remarkable to listen under 20 Hz
- These are connected to our deepest fears

High frequencies dissipate into the air
- Stampeding herd of animals / earthquake / volcano triggers the fight + flight 
  - hightens senses

"Adrenaline junkies"

### Pereceiving the rhythm

Present day: What gets us moving on the dance floor?
- study where they were asked to tap finger

  - people's brains reacted BETTER to OFF BEATS and LOWER TONES

Our human minds have a tendency to follow the bass!

### What researchers say

"Virtually all people respond more to the beat when it is carried by a lower pitch instrument(s)"

### Can't hear but dance

Eccentric scientists: Studying effects of bass on wildest party
- "undetectable very-low frequency sound increases dancing at a live concert"

Unseen Force = Bass Below 20 Hz
- undetectable to human ears
- participants had the following when the in-audible frequencies below 20 Hz were playing at the rave:
  - positive feeling
  - 12% more dancing

Remember this study when you high-pass your bass!!!

### The bass power charge

Northwestern Study: Impact in bass goes further than the dance floor
- has to do with perception of power

Listening to instrumental with/without bass:
- WITH bass: feel powerful

## Takeaways

Turning up the bass does the following:
- Super power / Super Saiyan

# 8/17/2023

## Westend - Ratio Edits Made Easy

Extended Mix: Full track
- DJ's play at nightclub
- full mix
- intro
- outro
- 

Radio Edit: Condensed version of the track
- Streaming platforms
- Youtube videos
- Shorter the better
  - More listens
  - Helps people with shorter attention span ha

Main difference: Length of time
- Extended: 4:30-6:30 minutes
- Radio: 2:30-3:45 minutes

Method #1:

Lazy man's radio edit: Cut the first 30 bars
- 2 bars remaining of 32 bar intro
- Goes right into the break
- Good to have:
  - Synth fill
  - Reverse crash into crash
  - Anything to create tension before the breakdown/vocal/meat of the track!

Method #2: 

Reverse Reverb Vocal
- James hype teases the pre-drop vocal at the very beginning of the song

Tips on getting crafty with radio edit:
- Condense long buildups

Method #3:

Quick Drop
- Vocal for first 2 bars
- Crashes during 2 bar
- Drop!
- 2 bars > Drop > Buildup > Drop
  - only 1 buildup

Ending:

Doesn't really matter how it ends with Extended Mix

It does matter for Radio Edit (want it to be interesting)
- Get this party started: Reverse effects to create a tail
  - White noise
  - Reverb reverb
  - Add delay/reverb so it slowly fades down in volume
    - Freeze/Flatten track to see the shape of waveform
- Number 1: Vocal with reverb
  - 
- Lollipop: Nothing really
  - A reverse crash (I think)

Takeaway: Spend WAY more time on beginning of radio edit than the end!

Rule of thumb:
- Regular: Change something every 8 bars
- Radio edit: Change something every 4 bars

How to make Reverse Reverb:
- Put reverb at end of chain
  - Freeze on
  - Cut off
  - all EQ/Diffusion network off
  - Dry wet at 92%
- Reverse the clip
- Freeze track (go to bar 1 to make this faster)
- Flatten track (converts it to audio)
- Reverse the large clip (the big brick of freeze ie. 'freeze tail')
  - You can delete the original clip, which is called 'freeze'
- Put on the finishing touches
  - delete everything besides the 4-8 bars that are furthermost right 
  - Bring it in front (line it up so that the very far right of the clip is touching the drop)
  - Bring the gain down a bit
  - Shape the clip so that it is a 1-4-8 bar fade 

- Optional: Add the following for extra FX:
  - Reverb (automate 0 to 50 as it approaches)
  - Delay (quarter note, ping pong, 20%ish for feedback and dry/wet)
  - Auto pan (automate Amount/Rate from all the way up to down)

Master this technique because it will help you transition to breakdowns and all new parts of a track!

## FOMO - Beginner Series

Let's go!

### 01 Getting Started

Bottom left: Info view
- tells what your mouse is over

Note: Command on Mac = Ctrl on Windows

Best Practice: Use 'Collect all and save'
- Keeps all of your files in 1 place
- Easier to share/send project files

Export
- wav: Uploading to streaming platforms
  - better quality, more data
- mp3: CDJ
  - less data

2 different views: Session and Arrangement:
- Session: Not used much
- Arrangement: What we will use to put music ideas together

Note: Switch between the 2 views with Tab

Audio vs. MIDI
- Audio: Pre-recorded music
- MIDI: Play instruments
  - bass

Device view: Looking at plugins and instruments on any single channel

### 02 Basic Key Commands

Most commonly used Key Commands!
- Reference the file below:

### 03 Splice

https://splice.com/sounds

### 04 Beat Basics

Very important: Reference track
- A track in a similar 'lane' as the one you will make
- if it is an .mp3, there will be silence at the beginning
  - make sure to move it over

### 05 Finishing the Drop



### 06 Arrangement

## Zookeeper - Instrumental Hooks

More about Melodies today!

Underlicks = Little hooks, in your chord progressions, that makes your stuff more catchy
- Best example: Heads will roll

Think about it:
- You have these chords
  - not singing these
- Little part inside of the chords
  - you are singing these!

Main thing: The little 'buh buh buh -- buh buh BUH buh buh'

We have all been in a position where we have cool chords, but it is not a "song song"
- Not quite a lead or hook
  - blurs the lines!

examples:
- A trak - yeah yeah yeah
- Calvin harris - I'm not alone (The song I heard in Ibiza!!!)
- Chris lake - free your body
  - something more clubby


### Calvin harris - I'm not alone (2019 Extended)
- Chords
- Underlick
  - 

Arpegiator:
- great
- nobody can sing over it though
  - write an underlick

### Chris lake - free your body

- Bassline
- Underlick
  - 'duh, duh duh'

### Making our own

Vocal: "Wasting my time with you, but I like it, I like it too"
- He finds the key by hand (Key = _)

Finding chords:
- he is messing around on the piano while the vocal plays

What can the underlick be to make it more catchy?

His process:
- Play the chords with one hand
- Come up with something catchy that can go under the chords
  - It will feel like a lead, but more simple
    - Callback: Short section that go with longer loops

Longer loops = Chords
Shorter loops = Underlick


## Sound Design 101 - FOMO

### Intro

How to develop sound design skills / get better at production in general!
- Most people: Just try to make music
- What you should do: Learn what the bigger artists are doing!!

This will help you develop your skills.

People don't have a production practice plan, which makes no sense because just like in sports, you have to practice 90% of the time.

### How to get better with sound design:

1. Remake sounds from songs that are popular
- Will be difficult at first
- Just starting out:
  - open Serum and pick a sound you like
  - open new MIDI track with init serum
  - slowly, 1 step at a time, try and re-make the sound with a reference

Yes, this sucks, but you have to do it to get better!!!
- it gets fun as you learn more

2. Listen to a 1 hour mix
- Remake songs, but take them to the next level (make it better!)
  - It doesn't benefit you to make it, you must be able to be creative with it

Set a 2 hour timer, every time you hear a sound you like, spend 10 minutes on it.

### Setting up Key Mapping

Ctrl-K
- setup a key to the solo button of the top/reference track
  - lets you listen back and forth to what you have / what they have

### Ways to get free answers for the MIDI Notes

1. Isolate as much as you can, just through the waveform. (Find the MIDI notes)

Example: He is re-creating Fisher's bass
- slaps on an EQ eight
- makes it bigger with the arrow
- checks where the bass hit is coming from (D#1)

Notes:
- This can be done with Spectrum
- Another way: Slap on EQ Eight, filter to only lows, and then put on a Tuner

As he opens up a piano roll and continues to find the bass notes:
- can hear it, but he can also see a waveform around D#

Note: He sees a note off the grid
- This is a note with swing
- It has 1/64th swing, as seen by the bottom right of the arrangement view
  - In a perfect world everything is on the 1/16th, but this bass note is off by 1/64

There is a lot of tells in the song that help you figure things out without guesswork:
- This is a 2 bar phrase, so he finds all notes in the first 2 bars
  - Don't be tricked into thinking the Kick is a bass note
    - It can be hard to figure out the note when a kick is also playing... zoom in!!

Notes:
- Once you figure out little intracacies, they will hold true throughout the whole song (usually)
- While in MIDI piano roll: Ctrl-A > Legato, this makes all the notes touch

### Replicating the Sound in Serum

2. Begin to try and replicate the Sound in Serum

- It is a darker sounding simple bass, so he puts the filter on (MG Low 12)
- It sounds like a pluck, so one of the following is true:
  - Moving through a wavetable position in OSC A (idk what this is...)
  - filters out some of the frequencies to start, and make envelope smaller (map the Envelope 1 to the filter cutoff w/ ~30)

- Filter Key Track (In Filter section) = ON
  - What it does:
    - Play higher note: Filter opens MORE
    - Play lower note: Filter opens LESS
    
Let's say if is not an easy sound to remake... Solo the original waveform + look at the harmonics

How to extract info from putting on EQ eight and viewing waveform/harmonics:
- Saw: Every harmonic in the series
  - Little lines, every 1 in the series

- Square wave: Only has odd harmonics
  - One way to know: Play a saw, then play a square, and see how some don't go all the way up anymore

Notes:
- 90% of sounds are basic shapes with distortion/effects on it
- Common effects:
  - Distortion: to make it warmer
  - EQ: 

### Beginners: Tip for if you get stick (Critical listening session)

MIDI outline of the song

Example:
- VOCAL WITH EFFECTS
- KICK WITH BASS AND VOCAL FX
- KICK AND BASS
- VOCAL, KICK, BASS, CLAP, OPEN HAT, PERC LOOP
- etc.

Repeat for every 8 bars to learn what is going on.

Notes:
- you cannot be creative with stuff you don't know yet!
- 90% of songs have same part
  - need to be creative with sound desing/vocal/etc.

Once you do this for an entire song, when you write your own music, it is less of a mystery!
- Can turn off reference
- You know what you are looking for

### Making the Chord Sound from Scratch (Going to be a tough one, it is cool...)

Chord sound

Low pass filter

Most likely: Root chord to start
- Would make most sense

Less harmonics: He tries a wavetable position further back
- ie. WT POS turns up/right in Serum

What we learned:
- Band pass is controlling a bunch of the ton of the sound
- Notes are super close

Key thing: We know the filter has a lot to do with it, and we sort of have the tonee down

Next steps: automate a bunch of stuff
- Tip: Ctrl-4 will remove the grid and let you do crazy automations

What we are doing: Harnessing randomness
- Do crazy automations
- Harness it in on your own

Trying out sounds in different spots
- Tip: Ctrl-Shift-Drag will let you change the part of the clip you are playing

Notes:
- When he wanted more distortion, he slaps on an Overdrive

Goal: Spend a couple hours per week learning stuff you don't know
- There is endless stuff to learn, so you have to learn so that things will start to make more sense!
- Learning sound design: Higher chance of finding your 'own sound' as an artist

## Drum Sample Organization - Sandor

### Full Tutorial



## Advanced Automation - FOMO

### Intro

Important!!
- Takes songs from 6-8 range till 8-10 range

Idea: Have a cheat sheet
- Go through the sheet and see if you have applied EVERYTHING to your track

Song = "Don't text or call me, I'm not sorry, I'm just at the after party"

### Analysis

Pretty much every track: FOMO Channel Strip

A way to think about automation:
- Coming in: Gradually
  - Use low pass so it is not harsh coming in
- Going out: Gradually

#### Lead Synth

Group: Low pass
- Comes down as the sound comes in

- 2 automations:

  - Pitch Bend: Used to glide between notes
    - -2 to 2 in Serum
    - Going up and down as you transition to new notes

  - Macro 1: Map to Coarse Pitch of OSC A
    - Goal: Turn Every sound in the breakdown as an FX element (this turns into a riser)
    - Go into Matrix > Macro 1 to ACoarsePit > Change to 12st
      - Automate this from 0 to 1 to go from 0st to 12st

Note: This is how they get a cohesive sound
- Not many sounds
  - Each sound is used for different things, though
  - No separate risers that have no context to the song

One more note: Using Utility/Mute is a way to get rid of a bunch of reverbs at once

#### Arp

A LOT of tension with this arp!

Note: Sound is also a riser (Took last phrase of the Arp melody and repeated for the 8 bar build!)
- There is also a 2nd Arp, but this one has differences:
  - 1 octave higher
  - More unison

Group: Low pass
- Comes down as the sound comes in

Arp:

- 4 automations total:

  - Macro 1: Mapped to the cutoff filter
    - Opens up over time to add tensions

  - B WARP: Mapped to the OSC B PWM (pulse wave modulation)
    - Adds tone change over time
      - Can be hard to hear. Main thing = Mess with something that changes the sound

  - EQ Freq Low: Automating the low end OUT as it rises in tension
    - High pass filter goes from letting in everything, to letting in just highs

  - EQ Freq Q: Automating the Q of the low end
    - 

Notes:
- How to To put Macro automation where you want it at 100%:
  - Map the Macro to the cutoff/automation and Put Macro 1 at 100%
  - Play a sound so that you can hear how aggressive that sounds
  - Turn down the blue amount automation until you like what you are hearing when Macro 1 is at 100%

- This synth Arp patch is the same as the bass patch
  - Good thing to do when you find a sound you like: Put it in another octave
    - Use it as a lead (sonically, makes your sounds sound like they are from the same kit!)


#### Vocal

The vocal goes like this:
- 8 bars: 8x 1 bar loops
- 4 bars: 8x 1/2 bar loops
- 2 bars: 8x 1/4 bar loops
- 2 bars: 1x Dry vocal

- 5 automations total:

  - Delay: 
    - Over the 16 bars (8 intro, 8 build) the Dry/Wet goes from around 30 to 50
      - Feedback 50%
      - L/R of 3
      - Ping Pong ON

  - Delay 2: 
    - Over last 8 bars (8 build) the Dry/Wet goes from 0 to 50
      - Feedback 50%
      - L/R of 1
      - Ping Pong ON

  - Endless Smile/Endless Smile RACK
    - Automate 0-100 up with curved parabola (He does so with 2 bars left, to leave room for vocal alone)

  - Endless Smile/Endless Smile RACK
    - Over the 16 bars (8 intro, 8 build) the Dry/Wet goes from around 25 to 0
      - Purpose: Bring in with a little

  - LFO TOOL
    - Device ON
      - Purpose: Sidechain?
  
Notes:
- Good to do all of these automations on a group vs. an individual channel
  - If you add another part of the vocal or something, you'd have to start it all over


#### Build Effects (On Master Channel)

Morgan: "On my buildups, it is almost always the same automations"

- 3 automations total:

  - Utility: Gain Reduction
    - Throughout build, automate 2-3 dB down
      - This will make the drop hit bigger

  - EQ Eight: Shelving the hi's
    - Automate a shelf that is bringing down the hi's as the buildup goes down
      - Only has to be ~2 dB

  - EQ Eight: Shelving the low's
    - Automate a shelf that is bringing out the low's as the buildup goes down
      - Only has to be ~2 dB

Note: For the previous 2 automations, make sure that the EQ Eight is turned OFF when not being used for those 8-16 bars.
- Phasing issues can occur if you just have that EQ Eight on

Key to all of this: Take things away SUBTLE so that drop sounds FULL when it hits!


#### Bass Effects

- _ automations total:

  - Optional: Fil Resonance
    - Kind of like opening up the filter, good for end of 4-8 bar loops

  - Low Pass Filter
    - When the vocal verse comes in
      - You always want to prioritize hearing the vocal (for the first time around, especially)


#### DROP GRP

- _ automations total:

  - Serum: Delay
    - On throughout the break, to add atmosphere

  - Serum: Envelope 1 release
    - Automates this up for the 2nd 8 bars of the break (turns into a buildup)

  - Auto Pan ON
    - Automates this up for the 2nd 8 bars of the break (turns into a buildup)
      - Amount: 100%
      - Rate: 1/16th

  - Optional: Pitch bend
    - 
      - For the last 8 bars of the break as it turns into a riser, pitching up 12-24 st

Note: Automating release up especially works good for a plucky sound
- Makes it louder
- You can affect the noise in some intense ways, since it last so long


#### Synth - LOW PIPE

- 2 automations total:

  - Reverb Rack
    - Device ON with Decay Time up for the 1st hit

  - Delay
    - Device ON for 2nd hits
      - Feedback/Dry Wet at 50%
      - L/R at 4
      - Ping Pong


Note: This is a rhythm of the following:
- single hit
- two hits back to back (du-duh!)

These help the sound not be flat!

#### Synth - HIGH VIBRATION

What this sound is: At the drop, a Lead/Pad type for 2 bars

- 3 automations total:

  - Serum Macro 1
    - Mapped to the Reverb
      - Adds a wash out effect

  - Pitch Bend
    - Goes from 0 to +12st in first 1/4 bar, stays up throughout the 2 bar sound

  - Muter
    - Turns on for the last 1/4 bar, and on, before the percussions all drops
      - Keeps it tight (sound doesn't bleed over)

#### Vocal Shot

What this sound is: 1 word of the vocal ie. a small 1/4 bar that was duplicated down

- 1 automation total:

  - Tonal Delay
    - Automates up the Feedback/Dry Wet/Timing of the Ableton Stock Delay
      - This track only has the vocal shot, so the automation turns on for just this little part of the vocal

Notes:
- Good way to add variation to a vocal/sound
  - You never want to hear the same part of a song, happen twice, in the exact same way!

#### Acid Sound

What this sound is: Same MIDI as before in Arp, but with a more Acid sound from Serum

- 3 automations total:

  - Fill Cutoff
    - Automate up 
      - Filter is opening up so that more high frequencies are let in

  - EQ Eight
    - Automate up
      - EQ out the lows 

  - Endless smile
    - Comes up during the 4 bar fake-out phrase
      - Adds tension
      - Comes back DOWN at the end to lead you into the vocal. This is next level!

  
#### Fakeout (Vocals)

- 1 automations total:

  - Endless Smile
    - Automates from up (~75) to down (0) in first 3 bars for a super aired out
    - Last 1 bar just has the full vocal before the drop

Note: There is still the vocal snippet with Tonal Delay below

#### Takeaways

Rule of Thumb: Always have 3-4 main automations on your key sound
- Vocal
- Main synths
- Bassline

This will help you have as much interesting stuff going on as possible!

## Mixing a Members Track - Westend

[Link to video](https://kick-bass.teachable.com/p/mixing-members-track-westend)

Notes

# 9/20/2023

What to do when "Media files are missing" in Ableton

Steps:
1. Find the original Project file
2. Drag in a Clap sample (or anything where you know you have the correct file, usually in the Imported folder)
3. Say 'Yes' when it asks to continue looking in that folder

4. To avoid this happening again: When saving, do the following: File => Collect All and Save

## SANDOR - CREATING A LOUD AND FULL LOW END

Creating a Loud And Full Low End - Sandor

[Link to Video](https://kick-bass.teachable.com/courses/creating-a-loud-and-full-low-end-sandor/lectures/44498981)

### Kick

1. Add punch to your kick with KickTweak

- is really bringing the main kick layer to life (extra punch, knock, and louder)
- Use Preset #8 to start, try #4 next
- Effect meter: play around with this (he has it around the middle)
- He has this on the main kick layer

2. UAD Pultec

- He uses this EQ plugin in every single kick and low end he uses
  --- It boosts up the lowend
- Low Frequency = 60 (30 if it needs more sub), Boost = 3
- He has this on the entire kick grouping
- Note: I will try boosting with EQ Eight for now, also got the free SonEQFree

3. Extra noise layer

- A lot of feedbacks he does for students, he says the kicks sound thin
- Remedy to this: Outside of kick group create a noise layer
  Steps:
- Drag Simpler into MIDI and bring a kick (Texture kick from Splice he used) into classic mode
  --- Make the MIDI pattern hit when the kick would
  --- Filter OFF, LFO OFF, Attack = 0, Decay = 1.93, Sustain = -Inf, Release = 1, Volume = -18
- Overdrive w/ 1110 Hz, 4.04, Drive = Tone = Dynamics = 50, Dry/Wet = 9-10
- Pro-Q 3 (I used EQ Eight) to ...
- Limiter w/ Ceiling -24 dB, Lookahead = 6ms, Release = 300ms

### Bass

1. FabFilter Saturn

- #1 recommendation when it comes to bringing up your bass [5:50] (He does this on all of his basses)
- It boosts the mids to bring the bass to life
  --- Crossover band between 100-300 Hz with Warm Tape preset, push the drive, bring up the band 7 dB (like an EQ)
- This makes a huge difference

2. Get a clean sub

- He EQ's out the lows to all of his bass (Anything under 40 Hz, this is the sub range)
  --- He has it at 41 Hz, .684 Q
- We do this because having a sub in the bass/serum patch is going to distort the sub
  --- We want the sine wave sub to NOT go through all of the processing (Direct Out)

To get a clean sub on its own:

- New MIDI with Simpler
- Put the same MIDI and Serum Preset into this MIDI
- In Serum, turn off the following: OSC A, OSC B, Effects ie. Compressor, EQ,
- Leave Sub on
- Put on Audio Effects -> Spectrum to see now you have a clean sub
  To Ensure that you can hear the sub in relation to the bass:
- Go to Session View
- Look at Bass and the new MIDI for Sub. Ensure that the sub is 9-10 dB quieter (For him, Bass is -11 and Sub is -20) [8:50]

3. Add a little width to your bass (and kicks):

- People say that your kicks and bass should be in Mono, which is a good rule, but all the big boys like Fisher/Chris Lake/Cloonee use this
- To create those full/wide low ends, it is really good to have some width on bass and/or kick
- plugin = bx_control V2 (He has this plugin on bass AND kick)
  --- Change In: M/S, Out: L/R
  --- Mono-Maker: 34 Hz (changes what Hz range will be in Mono ie. anything below 34 Hz is in Mono - because that's so low you don't have a wide %)
  --- Stereo-Width: 5% (adding too much sounds bad)
- Also has it on master, can look here to see if it changes anything [12:15]

4. Limiting

- Important technique he uses on all of his basses to make them sound louder
- FabFilter Pro L 2: It is squashing the sound together
  How he describes it:
- Song has a lot of loudness range on it
- With the limiter you are pushing everything up, but at the top (at a certain range) it gets cut off
- You get a thicker sound in a certain range
- Fuller, rounder sound (we want this for bass - instead of high some places/low in others)
  How to do it:
- Push up the gain until you start seeing some clipping ie. between 3 and 6 dB (this is fine)
- Preset he uses / talk of plucky bass: [14:10]
  Why he uses FabFilter > Ableton:
- When it comes to limiting, you are thinking of 'loudness potential'
  --- Mixdown trick: This is why some professionally mastered tracks sound louder, even though they are also at -0dB
- You can get higher loudness for the same effects w/ Fabfilter (Ableton has less loudness potential)
- Also, using Ceiling of -5 dB, Ableton's pushed through to -4.9 (when using 3dB gain)
  --- This is bad because it will cause distorting on portable speakers etc. (a real problem)\
  Another reason it is good to limit your bass:
- You want your bass more quiet than your kick, need a kick that can cut through the bass
- Rule: Kick is 5 dB louder than bass line
  --- Use a limiter to do so

5. Multiband Dynamics / Creating a chain for the bass
   (Replacement for Fabfilter Multiband Compression)

- Audio Effects -> Multiband Dynamics -> Hit Ctrl-G to group it -> Press bottom of 4 buttons on left to show Audio Effect Rack
- Right click -> Create Chain (in Audio Effect Rack), decide frequencies between low/mid/high
  --- mids = 1.5 dB, lows = 0.0 dB
  --- Had to play around to get the Multiband Dynamics to show. High = 2500, Mid = null, Low = 200
- By doing this, you can process the frequencies individually without affecting the rest
- add Kickstart 2
- add SPL Transient Designer Plus (use \_ for now)
- All of these together: Helping the low end of the pluck to be reduced while keeping the punch going / mids cutting through

6. Fabfilter Pro MB [23:11]

- Puts it at 100 sub/low range with Attack and Release near 0%
- He keeps mentioning distorting on portable speakers, how this fixes that
  --- It controls/suppressed the very start of the kick/bass which is causing the distortion
- You don't want this to affect how full your bass sounds
- Put this on both your kick and bass
- Overall: Listen on other speakers, adjust threshold/range (with attack/release) down
  ... until you don't hear distortion, then go back to normal speakers and make sure it sounds the same
- Also, but portable speaker

Takeaways [29:00]

1. Fabfilter Saturn (on bass)
2. Limiter (squash sound, create fullness) (kick + bass)
3. bx_control V2 to create width in the headphones (kick + bass)
4. Fabfilter Pro MB / Multiband compression to ensure it works across systems and bring down the subs

Following his steps from the end:
(He has basic layers of Kick layers, Bass, Sub layers,
Kick

1. Adds kick tweak to Kick grouping, Effect = Middle, Preset = 8
2. UAD Pultec to boost at Low Frequency, CPS = 60, Boost = 1
   Bass
3. He checks to see session view where bass is too loud (Kick = -1.5, Bass = -1.7)
4. Fabfilter Saturn to increase band 2 / mid level frequencies (He uses it as an EQ basically) [31:50]
5. Fabfilter Pro Q3 to EQ Out the Lows to make room for sub, Default Setting -> Low Cut, Brings circle down to left
6. Fabfilter Pro L2, Gain = +6, Output Level = -6
7. Sidechain with Kickstart 2
8. Listen on Portable Speakers / Regular speakers to compare

## FOMO - Workflow Tips & Tricks

### Splice

Splice Tips:
- Do: Sort by recent
  - Listen to previews of packs
    - "If the previews are shit, the pack is shit"
    - Once you find a good pack, click on the creator of the pack
      - You can see everything they've ever made
        - Most of this will be good!
    
- Don't:
  - Search "house" and scroll through
    - This will take forever
  
- Do: Once you find a sound you like, click 'Show similar sounds'

- Do: Put your Splice samples into a different folder
  - Splice organizes their samples by packs, which is shitty

### Changing a sample file

Instead of going in an changing each sample by hand, do the following:
1. Click on sample
2. Double click to open up > Right click the waveform below > 'Manage Sample File'
3. Change out audio sample

### Arrangement lock

The arrangement lock will lock the automations in place, letting you copy/paste as you please

### Intro/Outro

Intro: 16 bars
Outro: 16 bars
- First 8: Entire groove
- Last 8: Take out symbals

### Looking for Inspiration for the Drop

Once you find something you kind of like....
- Duplicate to have 3 separate drops
- Switch up sounds and MIDI randomly
  - Good way to try new ideas without needing to brainstorm/think hard!
  - Helps you get more ideas down...

Remember: This is all 1 big puzzle!

### If you run out of ideas, use Sting!64

Sting!64 with Drum Rack:
1. New MIDI channel
2. Add in a drum rack
3. Add in 16 different hat samples
4. Add in Sting!64
5. Duplicate the track (To ensure they have the same drum rack)
6. Click the red 'Record' button on the new track
7. Remove Sting!64 from the duplicated track
8. Press record!

Parameters for Sting!64:
- Density: How many notes you will get
- Transpose: 
- Swing: Adds swing
- Length: Number of 1/16th notes
  - Examples:
    - 4: 1/16 * 4 = 0.25 bar/1 beat
    - 8: 1/16 * 8 = 0.5 bar/2 beats
    - 16: 1/16 * 16 = 1 bar
    - 64: 4 bars

Notes:
- You can repeat the steps above with claps/snares to make drum fills
  - Make sure Sting!64 has Length of 8
  - Add 'A Standard Multiband Comp'
  - Add 'Utility' to Automate Volume up from -Inf for the fills
  

### Extra Tips

Extra Tips:
- Duplicate synths so that you do not need to re-do all automations and effects
  - Think: same sound, octave lower

- Duplicate entire parts of the track and paste in an empty section
  - Use this with Ctrl-I (insert time)

# 10/17/2023

## Livestream with Max Styler

### Overvolt - Melodic House Demo

Feel the track:
- tyler/westend: Take the kick/bass out so the listener can 'feel' the music
  - You want to be able to enjoy the melodies and vocals

Mix:
- Some things are too loud to how most people mix music 
  - vocal too loud
  - hats and drums quiet

Mixing:
- max styler: have an organized session
  - kick group, bass group, melodic group, etc.
  - much easier to have levels right for mixing
    - easier gain staging
  
Cooler style thing: Pick a more 'moving' bass
- max styler: bass was too static

### Leagas - Decompress (Extended Mix)

Me: This song is FIRE lowkey
- Love the off beat hi hat

max styler: I think this bangs!
- louder snare roll before 2nd drop
- horn sound: cleaner/layer with a lead on top of the horn sound
- mix: very solid

tyler: very cool
- elements could be elevated "ever so slightly" to add another dimension
  - example: arp on free rate, with speed changing not synced to BPM

### Playr One - MAKHE (Original Mix)

Me: eh
- on my speakers this hurts my ears

### Matt Hatter - Iniko - Jericho (Matt Hatter Remix)

me: idk

max styler: general vibe is cool
- bass: don't bring in at the beginning (hard to mix for dj's)
- vocals: overprocessed
  - overcompressed/limiting makes it feel shaky
  - this happens when the limiter is working too hard
    - the lower restlessness of the vocals comes out
  - also, some parts are too quiet and some too loud
    - it is tough to get vocals to work over drops + with melodic music this is tough
      - idea: vocals over the background, bassline for the drop

westend: structure of vocals on the drop
- not a super catchy hook
  - would rather dance to bass/drums instead of the vocals
  - move the vocal back in the break
  - use synth call/response
- mixing:
  - sections with a lot going on
    - if you have a bass/pad/synth, you need to carve out space
      - bass cannot have mid frequencies if the vocals are going to be playing
      - idea: trackspacer, filters/eq's to change sound in certain section
        - "i will turn on EQ on for just these 8 bars"
- songwriting/melodies: cool, just polish up

### JulianKumar - Crazy

westend: feels loop-y
- mixdown: cool
- arrangement: i don't like minimal usually
  - minimal
  - 2nd build can use more high energy
    - not a fan of anti climatic build
    - use a kick roll
    - i like the snare roll

maxstyler: general idea is cool
- bass: loud compared to kick
  - felt bass was muddy when it was just kick/bass
    - could just be sidechaining, but relationship should be tigher
- he doesn't play minimal either
- take out clap/snare on 2/4 so it is just hats for 1st half of the breakdown

### Low Audi0 - 24 Hours

Me: this is pretty cool

max styler: i don't have a ton to say, but great job / great track
- drums: clap is mono
  - layer it up with a couple panned l/r
    - not even hard pans necessarily, anything will help
- structure: solid
  - shorten first drop
- sound selection: good
- mix: good
- vocal: shift transient where we are cutting "we"
  - it feels delayed
  - use automation so that you adjust the start time
    - "i did this in resist"
    - add ping pong que while the start time is shifting 

tyler: "first 45 seconds idk, but i ended up liking it more an more"
- vocals:
  - normalize vocals
    - "we party" is way louder
    - agreeing with max on moving start time over
- mix:
  - synths could be brighter
    - high shelf EQ eight
- 2nd build:
  - really liked the fake-out then 2nd build
    - not predictable, which is good

### Ava Lake - Busy (Extended)

me: 

westend: great songwriting
- 3 parts of the song: hooky part, versy, spoken word
  - unless they all work together, that may be too much going on
    - advice: if you keep spoken word, use it at the end of the 1st drop
  - shorten the 1st drop OR progress the sounds
- mix:
  - bass not sidechained to the kick
- drums:
  - samples have sharp transients
  - low end not EQ'd
- vocals:
  - reverb on a vocal will highlight imperfections
    - use plugins or look at spikes in the audio
- lead in drop: could be stronger
  - sounds weak/plucky

max styler:
- vocals: simplify them
  - not giving it away too early ie. building it up
    - think of "on my mind" by diplo, the breakdown is a pad vocal thing, and then the full vocal smacks you in the face
    - remember: vocals over the drop could be cool, and this is a case here
      - find a more obvious hook, you may need to chop a piece up tho
- 1st breakdown: too long
  - possibly remove the whole 2nd half
  - keep the drums
- mix: song should be louder
- kick + bass: push the low end
  - not hitting as hard as it can

Westend now has a dinner to go to, Max says they will do 10 more minuteas

### Sonny Olivera - Darlin' V5

me: sounds quiet overall and i can't help but notice that
- clap fill is super quiet
- first buildup is super quiet and then the drop comes
- cool melody tho
- kick all of a sudden sounds loud AF

max styler: song is too long, solid idea
- bass: bring in at 30 seconds, not 1 minute
- drums/clap: all of the mix was off
  - clap: louder
  - transient of kick: too loud/clicky
- sample: cool
- middle section of the drop: monontonous/repetitive
  - take the drums out for a section

tyler: idea is too simple for this kind of production (felt flat)
- bass: 
  - not getting any variation in note length
    - how do i add movement 
      - automate release
      - lengthen notes
  - groove is on the grid
- drums: feel like you just put them in with no work
  - no layering
  - need more organic feel
    - go for jimmy jones paradise
- buildup: weak
  - reverb on the dry wet is not enough (need more musicality)

### CART3R - Safe Zone (Edit 2)

me:
- sounds loud / hurts my ears sorta
- vocals are cool and good idea so far tho
- buildup 1 is cool 
- i like the vocal chops / short vocal clips in the drop
- the boom boom boom into the break down was very cool
- 1st drop hits harder than the first

westend:
- vocal: good processing, but it is loud/coming in hot
  - vocal call and response < counter melody stuff
    - playoff with a synth
    - "some of the vocal chops did not do it for me"
      - 1 part of the word is kinda weak
- 1st drop: remove the 3rd 8 bar
- break: you are going for cinematic thing, but it is weird for house music
  - not a bad thing to be unique, felt crammed into 1 section tho with vocal still going on
  - give more space for things to exist
- key: some things felt out of key

maxstyler: 
- vocals: too over the top
- bassline: sick
- drums: sound great
  - kick may be able to go louder

encouragement for everyone: 
- kick/bass break after 1st drop is played out
  - you already have low energy with 8 bars of vocal, then 8 bars of kick/bass
    - people will be standing there doing nothing for awhile

### MatLo - Too Bad

me: 

max styler: 
- mix: too up front
  - take advantage of grouping / organizing your session
    - helps so much with mixing
    - helps see if things are in the right levels
- vocals: out of key?
- arrangment: hard to start with an arp
  - start with low cutoff so you can only hear midrange, use utility to bring it up slowly
- takeaways:
  - focus on gain staging your mix
  - take a glue compressor with soft clip, and  
  - eq out lows under 150 Hz in your vocals
  - pick your favorite artists in your genre, reference their style of mixing

tyler: 
- mix: hella distorted
  - sounds like you ran it into a limiter with a super high (Inf/1) ratio
    - everything is pushed to hell
    - hard to even push the mix
      - look at the waveforms lol, it is 1 big sausage
- vocals: sounds horrendous
  - take out the vocal 
    - quality was bad
    - very mid-heavy

## Height, Depth & Space - Sandor

Height: contrast between extremes in frequency spectrum (hi/mids/lows)
- height also comes into play when you are also talking about depth
  - good height:
    - deep bass
    - bright drums
  - bad height:
    - not full bass
    - low/mid/high are close together
    - everything in the mid-range!

Depth: front and back of your mix
- relationship between different instruments
  - loudness + voluem
    - if you want something in the front of your mix, you increase volume
      - low volume: back of mix
      - high volume: front of mix

- echo/delay
  - the actual sound is still in the mix, but the new sound is further back in the mix
    - makes the actual vocal sound more forward bc of the contrast

- reverb
  - cut out the low/hi end, and do a 1.2 second decay
    - helps add depth by bringing sound back in the mix

- transients
  - brings things forward in the mix
    - boosts the beginning of sound
      - makes it present at front, but doesn't muddy up mix (it only last a few milliseconds)
    - do for especially hat clap, they are the foundation of the drum groove (they are most essential to drums)
  - use plugin: nothing on ableton, SPL transient designer is $200, good free one is 

  
Space: stopping elements from clashing/fighting with each other
- figuring out where things can go
- main thing: width
  - one of the most important (and easiest) is choosing which elements will be wide in the mix
  - plugin: Wider
    - use this for vocals, synths
      - vocals on the side
      - NOT drums (phasing)

- taking elements out in the breakdown
  - lets you do 2 things that add space:
    - bring in more elements
    - add attention to what is already there
  - how to do this:
    - remove kick
    - remove bass
    - filter out drums (Bring down from 1st bar to 9th bar, then back to normal)
    - filter in a synth
- sandor:
  - "Spoonfeed the listener what they should be focusing on"
  - "Adds a moment where the listener knows something is about to happen"
Tools to use: 
- EQ: can add height/depth
  - Example: adding height with a high shelf (this brings up the high frequency of the drums)
    - they are brighter and now are present in the mix
- Wider: vocals/synths
- Filters: breakdown for adding/filter down elements

## How to Normalize a Track / Audio File

New way:

1. Drag in your clip
2. Consolidate with Ctrl-J
- Once consolidating is complete, Live automatically reduces the volume of the normalised clip/sample back to where it was before consolidating but you can quickly set this to 0db.
  - Open the clip’s properties and double click the‘gain.
    - This will set the gain to 0db and your clip is now normalized. 
  - Live will have automatically turned on the warp setting during consolidation, so also turn this off. 

Old way:

1. Drag into an empty Ableton session
- If you see that the waveforms are tiny, you may want to do this
2. Export Audio
- Make sure to highlight 'Normalize'
  - This will normalize the entire mixdown of the track, which in this case is just your 1 track.
    - You can normalize to 0dB, since this file is going to be dragged into the DAW again
    - Bit depth should be 32
      - because it is not done being worked with

## Phil Speiser Notes

### Chord Progressions using THE_HACK

Chord progressions:
- capital letters (I): Major chord
- undercase letters (ii): minor chord
- diminished chord: don't worry about for now
  - major scales: 7th key ie. for C major, it is B diminished
  - minor scales: 7th key ie for C minor, it is D diminished


Common chord progressions (Used in ALL genres):

1. The all time winner: I - V - VI - IV
- 90% of all hits us this progression
- Most often key: C
  - C major to be exact
- Summary: Basic, but effective (When in doubt, use this!)

2. The all time winner (dark version): VI - IV - I - V
- Same chords as the all time winner, but starting at the middle point
- Used in biggest melancholy hits
- Good for a sad vibe

3. Unobvious hit: VI - V - IV - V
- Has a perfect mixture of uplifting, yet nostalgic

4. The twist: I - VI - IV - V
- Same chords as the all time winner, but you change the order

5. Phil's personal favorite: I - IV - VI - V
- Mixed feelings (Not sad, but not happy)
- Makes you feel a lot
- Strong progression with lyrics
  - Gives them a deeper feel, more sophisticated

---



More - Dance progressions:
1. VI - IV - I - VII
2. I - II - III - V - IV - VII

Note: These all have rhythm patterns that I cannot replicate, may need to download from online or use THE_INSTRUMENT.

More - Neo Soul:
1. II - V - I
---

Takeaways:
- These are important for all genres
  - Specific genres will have their own ie. the Dance Progressions we went over above
- Don't always do 1/2 bars for each chord
  - Make one note shorter, and the one after it longer
    - Best way to do this: 

### What's new 1.4 - Midi Export & Chord Dictionary (THE_INSTRUMENT)

MIDI export with the record button: 
- Hit record button, to start
- Play notes
- Hit record button, to end
- 'Drag MIDI' OR 'Show MIDI Folder'

MIDI out to record MIDI into an empty/different track (Good for using sounds in Serum)
- New MIDI track in Ableton
- Change 'Ext. In' to 'THE_INSTRUMENT
- Change 'All Channels' to 'THE_INSTRUMENT
- Press Ctrl-red record button (So both tracks are red)
- Optional: Press blue 'In' button
- Begin playing notes!
  - If you hit record at the top, both your THE_INSTRUMENT track AND your new MIDI track should be recording notes

Chord Dictionary: 
- Press 'Book' Icon next to Chord
- Select a preset ie. The all time winner: I - V - VI - IV
- Note: Some of these have rhythms, which is awesome!!!!

### How I will use this going forward

How I will use this going forward:
1. Turn on Chord mode, select a good combination of Key/Chord type

2. Find a Chord Progression in the Chord Dictionary, drag it into the DAW
- Rename the MIDI file to be like this: 'Cmaj (Dance Chords - Basics Major), I - V - VI - IV'

3. Create a new MIDI file and setup the following:
- Instrument: Serum
- Change top 2 settings ('Ext. In/All Ins' and 'All Channels') to 'THE_INSTRUMENT'
- Press red 'record' button (so that Serum track records what notes THE_INSTRUMENT plays)

4. Press 'Record' at the top
- Watch how the chord notes go into the Serum track

5. Optional: Turn on THE_RHYTHM for a Rhythm
- Favorites: Dance, Basic Rhythm 1/2/3, Slide it, Disco Disco

You now have MIDI that is in-key and that you can mess around with!


# How to steal songs from a full set (optimal/loud version)

1. Drag the full set into your DAW
2. Take the snippet you want and put it at Bar 9 of the track it is on
3. Slap on a mastering level Pro-L 2 + push to taste
- Only use this if you need to
4. Freeze track
5. Flatten track
6. Consolidate OR Export Audio
- Recommendation: Export Audio (This way you can fade in/out, create extended mixes, etc.)
  - Make sure to solo the Track + Master channel has nothing on it!

Tip on exporting quick and having room at front and back: Highlight the clip, Ctrl-Shift-R, 
- Example 1:
  - Render start: 8.3.1 -> 8.2.1
  - Render length: 136.2.0 -> 137.3.0
- Example 2:
  - Render start: 8.3.1
  - Render length: 


If you want to compare the before/after, do this after freezing:
1. Duplicate the frozen track
- For one: Flatten
- For two: Un-freeze, remove Pro-L 2
2. Compare loudness!
- Look at waveforms
- Use Youlean Loudness 2

## DJ Carlo - EQing is dead. Use this instead

Stems > EQ

EQ:
- Lows
- Mids
- Highs

Stems in intro of video:
- Vocal
- Melody
- Bass
- Drums

### Steps to setup Stems on Rekordbox

Steps to setup Stems on Rekordbox:
1. Ensure you have the latest version of Rekordbox
- It will ask you to update at load if not
- Another way to check: Help -> rekordbox update manager

2. TRACK SEPARATION function
- Preferences -> Extensions -> Enable the TRACK SEPARATION function

Note: You will now have mute buttons for the following:
- Drums
- Vocal
- Instrumental

3. Get Stem Functions on your Rekordbox DJ Controller
- [Rekordbox DJ Stem Mappings](https://djcarloatendido.sellfy.store/p/rbstems/)

Note: I use XDJ and not a controller, so this is not applicable...

### Stem mixing with Low Quality Audio
- This will cause the stems to be shit and have lots of artifacts
- Recommendation: use .wav files ie. bitrate of 1411 kbps at 16 bits (Sounds superior to .mp3)

### Mix in Key on Rekordbox DJ

Mixing in key is best for a harmonious blend.

Technique we can use with our DJ software:
1. Analyze tracks
2. Make sure keys are viewable in the browser section
3. Go to settings and make sure you will see key on your controller/CDJ

### Create Mashups with Stems

Favorite ways:
1. Mix 'Buildup of current song' with 'Chorus of next song'
- Ideal: Current song's buildup has as a chorus
- How to do:
  - Isolate vocals of next song
  - Play next song's vocals once you reach the chorus of the current song


2. Mix 'Chorus of current song' with 'Intro of next song'
- Ideal:
- How to do:
  -

## Phil Speiser - Melody Generator of THE_INSTRUMENT

Steps:
1. Pick a Key, turn on Chord Mode, find a chord preset you like

2. Lay down some bass chords via THE_DICTIONARY or recording in your DAW
- 

3. Open the Melody Generator via the button under THE_RHYTHM

4. Hit 'Play' in your DAW
- You will hear the Melody be generated based on the MIDI file you are over

5. Final steps - Once you like the melody, do the following:
- Drag the MIDI notes into a new MIDI track
- Turn off the chord generator of THE_INSTRUMENT track (Otherwise it will keep playing in the background)
- In the new MIDI track, switch to Serum OR turn off Chord mode

Note: MWhen you have something you like, make sure to drag your MIDI into your DAW
- When you hit 'Generate Melody' OR open the DAW again, there will be a new melody (You can't recover old ones)


## Stealing a Clap with Millean

How to do this: Phase cancellation!

Explanation:
- Take a waveform
- Take a waveform that is the exact opposite
- There will be no noise
  - This is how you remove the kick from the clap in the extended intro

Steps:
1. Take a 1.2/1.4 (Kick+Clap)
2. Take a 1.1/1.3 (Kick Only), add a Utility and click the L/R buttons
- If you freeze/flatten, you will see that it was turned around
3. Layer them so they play at the exact same time
4. Resample the tracks

You should have a clean clap!

## FOMO - Drop Vocals

### Vocal ideas

1. Loop your drums pattern
- "flow gibberish"
- hum some rhythms

2. 80s hip hop vocals

3. Look at lyrics without listening to the song
- 

### Settings for Recording

Latency - makes it hard to record the vocals
Remedy: Bounce out with a project file that does not have plugins with latency
- Open a project file
- Plug in your mic
- Buffer size as low as possible 
- You are ready to record!

Microphone choice:
- Old school vocal: 
- ...
- Takeaway: You don't need a super nice microphone

### When recording

1. Turn down the beat
- You can still hear it

2. Stand up
- Takes you out of tunnel vision
- You will "get into it"

3. Get a good take!
- You will feel it when you do it

Note: very hard to fix a poor vocal recording

4. Ad-libs
- Random ...

### How to fix a non-perfect alignment

1. Move words around
- Complex Pro
- Make a transient on the word
  - Ctrl-4 will let you do it with more precision
- Arrange the words so they fall on the beat

Note: This should not take long! Do another take because warping makes it sound bad!

2. 

3. 

### Remedies for bad takes

1. Stack 2 takes on top of each others

### Finishing touches with the sample

1. Try messing with the key/semitones
- This will see if other keys will sound better for the trick

## Sandor - Mixdown explaining video ie. Giving me feedback on my Taylor Swift remix!!!

Location of video: C:\Users\Myles\OneDrive\Documents\Music\Remixes and Edits\Taylor Swift Me Remix\wetransfer_taylor-swift-snd-master-v1-wav_2023-11-03_1432\2023-11-02 17-00-36.mp4

Before specifics: I spent a lot of time on this one
- Starters: Mixdown starts with sounds you select
  - You can't have loads of sounds in the same frequency range (You have loads of sounds fighting for the same space)
  - The taylor swift vocal is phase-y and not a great sounding quality

Note: I will let you know if there are rules, or if I just "heard something" with my trained ear
- Lots of EQ/volume work in this track

### Kick + Bass

Kick:
- KickTweak (#8 usually)
- Black Box Saturator (Adds some mid texture)
- bx_control v2 (6% stereo width on 39% and above)
- LFO tool (Shortens up the kick)
- Saturn: Pushing them mids of the kick between 100-256 Hz
- Extra EQ shelf (For more top)
- Extra EQ shelf (For less low-end)

Bass Group (Otto Bass Sub + Chris Lake mid bass): Good job, just did more processing to make them sound more together
- Saturn: Push between 100-300 Hz (Adds so much weight to the bass)
- UAD Pultec: 60 Hz range
- Pro-L 2: Limiter to push/squash it down together (Denser sound)
- Compressor: Sidechain from ghost kick
  - 100% mix, Threshold at -16, Ratio 4:1, Instant attack, Release 45.0 ms
  - ghost kick: 
- EQ: Boost the low end
- SSL Compressor: Glue the bass together more

Reece bass in intro/breakdowns:
- Limiter to squash it down (Want it denser)
- Kickstart 2

RULE: Get Kick+Bass together / at the right levels
1. Solo the kick (to see where the root of the kick is hitting)
- Throw on a spectrum analyzer to see what key/db you are hitting at (Mine is at G#0 at -4 dB)
2. Repeat with the bass
- You want it to be ~3dB quieter in the sub

### Drums

Drums GRP: "I made them louder for you"
- Thermal: Overhead slam preset (2% to make them more full)
- UAD SSL Compressor with ~3-4 dB gain reduction (Slow attack to let transients through, medium release to catch tails of sounds)
- Volume work: Utility
- EQ: Add a shelf to the top ~1.5dB
- MSED: Mid side EQ to make the stereo/stuff on the side louder
  - Side gain = 5dB

Individual drums:
- Main hat: Make louder/fuller
  - Overdrive at 5% to push the highs
  - EQ to push the highs
  - Pro-L 2 to knock of 1.5-2dB of harsh transient 
  - Utility for volume work

- Clap:
  - Overdrive at 25% (A lot of overdrive)
    - Fills out drums nicely
  - EQ to bring up highs (Drums were a bit _)
  - Pro-L 2 (Bring harshness down, make denser)

- Closed hat (Skippy/short hat):
  - EQ below 1k
  - Sidechain to the main hat
    - Lets the main hat shine through/drive the song
  - Kickstart 2 to sidechain to the kick (and clap b/c that's on the same)

- Percussion: Needed to boost up + make louder
  - Overdrive at 20%
  - Adaptive EQ for boosting up the stereo/sides (600Hz, 4dB, Q=0.12)

- Snare hit: Needed to add more bite/transient
  - Virtual Mix Rack: Pushes the transient up (Aggressive)
  - StandardCLIP: Uses to tone down the clipping
    - Nice trick to tone done the aggressive clipping

- Ride: 
  - Limiter: Take away harsh transients
  - EQ: Remove harsh ringing notes (smoothens it out)
  - Pan left (Another element hitting at same time)

- Noise short (Playing same time as ride):
  - EQ out the highs above 17k hZ
  - Pan right (Another element hitting at same time)

- Ride 2: 
  - EQ out under 400 hZ
  - Surgical EQ to remove ringing / harsh frequencies

- Snare Bus:
  - Compressor (instant attack and 241ms release at -20 dB Threshold, Ratio 4:1)
  - Overdrive at 12%
  - Virtual Mix Rack: Pushes the transient up (Aggressive)
  - StandardCLIP: Uses to tone down the clipping
    - Nice trick to tone done the aggressive clipping

### Leads

Note: This is where it got really hard, mixing with the vocal

Leads/Pads/Keys group:
- Trackspacer: Brings down lead to let vocals, Amount ~1/3 (Sidechained to the vocal)
  - You want to hear vocal more than synths, so they can sing along
  - Synths/leads: Compliments to the vocal

Leads/Piano group:
- EQ: Boost sides of the piano 2.5dB around 320 Hz (Subtle, but helps give it nice weight without clashing with kick)

Piano:
- EQ: Boost high ends
- Pro L-2: Smoothen out/make denser
- Kickstart 2: 18% to let kick through
- Wider: 59% to add width/space to fill out the track
- Utility: 
- Saturn 2: Drive with Warm Tape  
- Compressor: 
- Trick he used w/ a Audio effect rack in '' song breakdown to keep mono presence via a parallel utility and mixing: 
  - MONO: -9.6 dB, Utility for 100% Mono
  - STEREO: -0 dB, nothing on this chain
- EQ: Take out some mids for vocal (No explanation, he just used his ears)
- Compressor: Smoothen harsh start to the piano (4:1, instant attack, super fast release of 22.2ms, Threshold at -10 for ~1dB gain reduction)
- Pan 5L (Make space for the lead melody that ends up going 5R)

Lead Melody:
- EQ: Cut below 300 Hz
- EQ: Boost mid/highs for brightness
- Pro-L 2: Squash ~3dB
- Kickstart 2: 
- Utility: Boost 2dB
- Utility: Mono bass under _ Hz
- Pan 5R (Make space for the piano that ends up going 5L)

Lead Melody 2: He split these apart because the octave jump needs different processing
- EQ: Cut below 300 Hz
- EQ: Cut mid/boost highs w shelf
- Pro-L 2: Squash ~5dB (Push even more in the limiter +16 to change amount)
- Kickstart 2: 
- Utility: Boost 2dB
- Utility: Mono bass under _ Hz
- Pan 5R (Make space for the piano that ends up going 5L)

Disco Lines pluck: Limiting for volume, simple sound tho
- EQ: Anything below 122 Hz
- Utility: 
- Limiter: Ceiling -9 dB

Pad: Needed a lot of saturation
- EQ: Below 240 Hz
- Saturn 2: Boost/Drive w Warm Tape for brightness
  - Compensate because of boosting brightness on the others
- Limiter: Simple smoothing at -9dB
- Reverb: Dry/Wet 41% (Common with pads to add space)
- Pro-MB: Compress with instant attack/fast release 12.2ms to smoothen out the start of the sound in 1.5-10k range (He felt that it was quite harsh)

### Vocals

All VOX GRP:
- EQ: Boost mid/highs
- Audio Effect Rack for Mono parallel trick
  - MONO: -8dB with Utility for Mono
  - STEREO: 0dB, nothing on chain
- Limiting at -9 dB (This caught any time when there was multiple vocals playing at once)

Vocal Chops GRP: 
- EQ: Anything below 170 Hz
- Pro-Q 3: Stereo field control
  - Boost width of highs (Piano is wide in low mid)
  - Lower width of mids (Piano is wide in mids)
- Pro-MB: Smoothing from 4k to the top to compress the sound
  - Felt there was Harsh/brightness at the top (It was hurting his ears)

Chop 1:
- EQ work similar to the whole chops group
- Limiter: Take out the harsh highs
- Utility: Bringing it back down center (Piano and other stuff are highs)
- Sidechain to Chop 3
  - When you bring in chop 3, you sidechain since they were fighting for the same space

- Chop 2/3: Nothing, besides EQ below 170 Hz

Vocal GRP (Main acapella group): 
- EQ below 170 (This was me)
- Kickstart on in the drop (This was me)
- Pro-L 2: Limiting (Gain +16 so that )
- Utility: 

Individual Acapellas:
- He leaves in my saturation
- EQ work: Bring up the low/mid weight, pushing the highs

Note: This sound was shit (stolen acapella), so he could not do much with it

### FX

FX GRP: Sidechained with trackspacer to the vocal + the synths (Don't want them taking over space, want vocal to cut through)
- Trackspacer: Mix 100%, Sidchain input is the VOX GRP
- Trackspacer: Mix 100%, Sidchain input is the LEAD MELODY GRP

Noise/Cymbals/Risers:
- Kickstart 2: Sidechain to kick at 12% mix
- Saturn 2: Warm Tape to saturate the highs (Gives them all the same kind of sound)
  - This is good for when using sounds from different packs
- EQ: Boost highs stereo field (Width on white noise makes it sound good)

Individual tracks FX: None

Snare: 2% overdrive (The other snare drowns this out)

808: Muted

### Mastering

Note: Mastering is a whole different concept, takes forever to go over

Chain:
- soothe2: Take away harsh frequencies
- Utility: -22dB for volume control before next step
- Pro-MB: Upward compression for the quiet parts of the song
- Utility: +22dB for volume control after next step
- UAD Neve: Mastering compressor for analog tone
  - Has sidechain so anything below 400 Hz does not trigger this compressor
- Pro-MB: 1.11:1 compression for the entire sound
- Vitamin (s): Exciter plugin
- Pro-Q 3: Boost sides at ~700-800 Hz for width
- StandardClip: Clipping sound, taking harsh peaks
- Ozone Imager: Add some width to the mids, more to the highs
- Parallel processing compression:
  - MONO: -11dB
  - STEREO: 0dB
- Limiting with 2dB for extra loudness

Recommendation: Mastering is WAY harder than mixdown, always use a mastering engineer!

## 11/28/2023

Me going through the project file to get approximate levels that I should shoot for on my projects going forward:
- Kick root note 3db louder than the bass peak within spectrum analyser
- All other groups , drums, synths, vocals quieter than the lowend grouped together db wise
  - no specific number, just the lowend should be the loudest thing in the mix

"The only rules I follow are:
Kick root note 3db louder than the bass peak within spectrum analyser
All other groups , drums, synths, vocals quieter than the lowend grouped together db wise, no specific number, just the lowend should be the loudest thing in the mix
Then I just use my ears, going for what sounds good is important because your training your ears to immediately know when something is wrong, this comes from spending lots of time constantly comparing to reference tunes"

### Tightening a loop

This will 1/2 or 2x the size of the loop.

Steps:
1. Get into a loop
2. Press the 1/2 button

Note: You can do this with the out button and jog wheel, but this is harder than pressing the 1/2 button.

## Zookeeper - Track Feedback (Taylor Swift - Me)

Your feedback has been completed ✅
Congrats! Zookeper reviewed your track and the following notes were made:
Overall thoughts:
Biggest issue i'm hearing here is that the track and the vocal are seemingly in two different keys. So it's not properly locking in. The parts themselves are good and work, but without fixing this its gonna be tough for it to sound right.
Key areas to improve:
There are some balance issues with some of the element. Pianos are loud, build snares are a bit quiet
Again, the biggest thing for me here is that the vocals and track aren't in the same key. Need to fix this.

## Heider - Track Feedback (Lil Uzi Vert - Now I Do What I Want)

*this was a video*

Hey there! 👋 Heider has completed your video feedback. ✅
Here is a link to your feedback: ➡️ https://www.loom.com/share/460d8d9b8db349bba7a6876edb56705e

### My notes

Vocals: Really harsh
- Top heavy, no body
- May be boosting at 3k+ too high
- Vocal is also way too loud
  - When he turns on EQ around 1500 at -8 dB, it sounds better
- Vocal is not matching the beat
  - Can be tricky but is necessary
- Ringy/distorted around 2-3K

Instruments: Boring
- Bring in more movement

Clap: Dry
- Give reverb/delay

Main hat: Too loud
- 

Bassline: Boring in intro
- The breakdown bass is goood, apply the pitch bend etc. in the intro too!
- Beware: Watch out for higher volumes when your pitch goes up 
  - Higher pitch == Higher perceived loudness 
    - Check your meter/mixer and see if volume goes up
      - If yes, you can do the following:
        - Compress bass
        - Adjust velocity of notes
        - Avoid 2 notes at once

Melody: Could be better
- "I know Uzi usually uses some ravey synths, so that could work for a house remix"

Snare roll at drop 2: Too busy
- Tie it together better

Intro/Outro: Longer for Dj's

## Pro-Q 3 - How to setup Dynamic EQ
(
Once and for all - no more guess work lol)

Steps:
1. Split Project file into Vox Bus vs. Non-Vox Bus
2. Add Pro-Q 3 on the non-vox Bus
3. Make a cut at ~500 Hz
- Right click -> Shape -> High Shelf
4. In Ableton, make the sidechain input the Vox Bus
5. Lock in the settings of the dynamic EQ
- Pull down dynamic range to -30dB (This is for effect)
- Press 'Auto' (this turns it from Auto -> Threshold)
- Press 'External side chain' button (it is right by threshold bar, and will light up blue)
6. Check that the dynamic EQ is working.
7. Once you know it is working, put the dynamic EQ threshold ~-2dB

## How To Make a New Piano House Track using the Paul Woolford method

### Intro

Heat Tribute

Lessons:

Piano:
- extensions, not afraid to be weird for common tones or melody/movement's sake
- double octave bass, 3 notes right hand
- 90s stagger
- acoustic chilled version of riff for the verse

Chord Progression:
- Lifting emotion from chord progression from always rising ie. 6-7-1-4

Staccato String Counter Melody:
- counter to counter?

Piano, vocal, string need to work together
- is that why the string was just quarters?

Break suspensions, less lifting extensions

High Rhodes/sine fluff
- high string type

Arrangement:
- verse, pre, vocal chorus, post hook, couple of hands in the air moments
- pad break

Production:
- minimal DJ build, no EDM snare, just high pass on btrack to let vocal through
- vocal doing most of the work, no energy change
- 'fake' bass octave trick (for higher keys)

### Vocals

We won't beat 'Heat' vocals without dedicated session with vocalist (surprise...)

Splice
- 'Deep Tech House' from Dropgun Samples
- file: _

Goal: matching energy
- not full belting/gospel
- not super chill/laid back
- somewhere in between!

About the vocal:
- mostly square ie. no syncopation
  - Piano House Rhythm Video #2 goes into this
  - tldr; square vocal gives us a lot of freedom regarding the piano rhythm
- key: d minor
  - tip: write MIDI in Amin (so we don't have to learn scales lol)
    - pitch up (5st in this case)

What he does next:
- Find the melody ie. location of notes ie. where the vocalist says words
  - luckily: all of them fall square ie. on 1/8th grid
- Finds the correct pitch for the keys
  - Idk how to do this still, so I would just do something until it sounds right

What he says about the melody:
- "what this tells me - most of the melody is based around chord 1"
  - "except for the turnaround, which is based on 2 and 7, but that resolves around the 1"

What this tells us about the chord we will make:
- first 3 bars: chords will come from 1 ie. a-c-e
  - "chord 1 with a passing note" ie. 
- last bar: chords could come from _ ie.  or _ ie. 

1-6-4 trick will come in handy

Next: Check if there are any lyrics we want to emphasize
- no, but the hook is the "we both know it right away" in bar 4

### Piano

Takeaways from analyzing Heat:
1. Extensions
- paul loves extensions
- he even used a 6th (instead of 7th or 9th)

2. 3 notes upper chord
- one instance: he even deleted a main triad chord note to make room for an extensions
  - what this means: he cares more about extra interest in the chord > traditional triad
- upper chord = right hand

3. Staggered piano bass
- between bottom and top notes in piano (more on this later)

4. Chord Progression: Lifting
- constantly rising ie. 6-7-1-4
  - seems deliberate because; after the 7 AND after the 1 he could have gone down


First thing: get a good piano rhythm 
- vocal is square ie. 8th notes only
  - we can pretty much do any rhythm with our chords then!

How he starts out the chords:
- copy/paste the rhythm of the vocal for its 1st bar and draw in A0 notes (he has 6 notes in this 1 bar)
- copy that up to A1, C2 and E2 (this makes the chords)
- try editing the rhythm by removing notes and/or adding some dotted 1/8 notes (only square rhythm is lame)

note: make sure when you change something, to try the rhythm out in all stages (pre, verse, drop, after drop)

duplicate this finished 1 bar out to 4 bars and proceed!

Next: Choose the chord progression
- we have 7 options
  - usually good: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
  - usually stay away from: 2 and 5
  - what paul started on: 6-7-1-4

- listen and try different options out (only have the bottom notes on when doing this !!! )
  - options we tried:
    - 6-1-3-4 ie. f0, a0, c1, d1 (first try)
    - 1-3-4-6 ie. a0, c1, d1, f1 (best option that we went with!)
    - 1-3-4-7 ie. a0, c1, d1, g1 (weird end)
    - 1-4-6-7 ie. a0, d1, f1, g1 (solid)

Let's press on with our favorite!

Next: begin to develop the chords in full

- left hand:
  - bars 1-4: a0-c1-d1-f1 in the bass with a1-c2-d2-f2 above that (just adding a 2nd note to the bass/left hand)

- right hand:
  - bar 1: g2-c3-e3
    - started as a2-c3-e3
    - we added extension of g3, and therefore removed the bottom a2 (to keep right hand at 3 notes)
    - sounded high, so revoiced from c3-e3-g3 to g2-c3-e3 (flipped the g3 down to g2)
    - pasted this for all 4 bars
      - note: method of putting chords above bass note is best, use invisible notes to help guide your decisions

  - bar 2: g2-b2-e3
    - started as e2-g2-b2 (he started at bass note ie. c2, added 4, then 3, then 4 ie. skip one pick one)
    - revoiced e2 up to e3
  
nice bonus: we now have 2 common tones (g2 and e3) with an internal melody forming between those (c3 down to b2)

  - bar 3: a2-c2-e3
    - started as f2-a2-c2 (go to bass note ie. d2, skip one picks one)
    - once again: revoice the bottom f2 up to f3
    - we could keep it here, but decided to keep the common chord and move f3 down to e3

  - bar 4: a2-c3/b2-g3
    - starting note: we need a break from all common tones on this one! (breaking off on chord 4 is common - paul did this)
    - started as a2-c3-e3 (go to bass note ie. f2, skip one picks one)
    - no revoice needed since we are already up there
    - now, to separate the last chord:
      - moved our 7th (e3) to 9th (g3) [paul changed his extension to a 9th, that's why we did this]
      - played around with moving to vocal, decided to split middle into 4 notes c3, then 2 notes b2
        - note: he realizes the vocal did this in bar 2 as well, moved the e3's down to d3's

Next: Staggered bass notes
- current state: our bass is on the same rhythm with the right hand's chords
- future state: we have some variation
- how to start:
  - obvious places to try = end of bar (especially if there is dotted 8's because we aren't moving right next to a note)
  - what he tries: 
    - moving furthermost 2 notes over by 1/16th and lengthen from 1/16 to 1/8: good energy, too busy (maybe OK for chorus but...)
    - moving furthermost 1 note over by 1/16th and lengthen from 1/16 to 1/8: lost too much energy

- what he settles on: 2 last notes go over, add in a 2nd sine wave bass makes the move "less significant"

### Bass

Next: 2nd bass ie. Sine wave bass
- use the notes at the top of chord rhythm ie. ignore the stagger we were just working on!
- lengthen the notes (piano notes are little blocks)
  - first note and 4th/middle note especially, or anything with more than dotted 1/8


Note: We may take these stagger notes out in the verses, but keep in the drop.
     
### Staccato Strings

Staccato Strings: a counter melody to the vocal

Note: Doing this next so we have it for arrangement time, so we have vocal + piano + counter melody (They all need to work together!)

Paul's method:
1. take top notes of the piano and put them on the kick drums
- for us top of piano ended like this: e4-d4-e4-g4

(this sounds good af to me)

If we don't want to copy Paul, we can do something else:
- our vocal is a lot busier anyways, (especially in the chorus) so let's follow the vocal melody
- first thought: follow vocal melody
  - we are already in a similar pitch area

Steps:
1. Take the vocal melody from earlier
- remove the notes that don't hit on the kick
- shorten the notes so they are 1 bar on a 1/8 grid
- duplicate this for all 4 bars

what we have now: a3-b3-c4-e4

2. Optional: add variation
- bar 2: switches some notes up
- bar 4: moves 1st note from a3 to g4, 2nd note stays, 3rd note from c4 to g3, 4th note from e4 to a3

### Verses

Verse: Take the main riff and calm it down a bit
- Velocity of all notes: 127 down to 82
- Chill out the rhythm: Take out all of the staggered parts (in the bass)
- Lengthen notes: Extend those last 2-3 notes from being 1/16 to being a tad closer to 1/8 (He did the last 3 notes)

Pre-Chorus: Pick the energy up
- Velocity: Match the vocal (For him he solos both and this is ~96)
- Rhythm: Keep the staggered bass
- Lengthen notes: None

Chorus: What we were working on the whole time...
- Velocity: 127
- Rhythm: Keep the staggered bass
- Lengthen notes: None

### Post/Break: 

Notes:
- What was great about paul's arrangement:
  - Verse
  - Chorus
  - Main Chorus
  - then... Post Chorus Hook
    - 8 bars of pad breakdown
      - 4 bars: vocal + chords
      - 4 bars: vocal + chords + hat + clap 
      
  - Semi-Drop ie. "hands in the air moment" (Piano and kick drum are playing)
    - 8 bars: kick + piano

  - Why this is great: 
    - most producers: 
      - would run 8 bar chorus, then run the beat over the post-hook
      - you end up with a double chorus ie. drop 1b
      - then, 8 bar breakdown before verse 2
    
    - Paul:
      - is a DJ and realizes that those 8 bars lose too much energy when playing live
      - idea: swap sections
        - still have breakdown/post-chorus hook (to sing over the break)
        - still have drop (to hear piano in full glory, AND get a break from the vocal, BUT don't lose energy of song)


Pad section:
- changed chords around to add suspensions (for suspense)
- how to:
  - take all first notes (of all 5 notes in the chord) and hit legato so they are 1 bar long
  - 
    - bar 1: our vocal is on note 2 (which is the 9th of chord 1/a) so we have c3 down to b2
    - bar 3: brings c3 down to b2 (b2 is the 6th of the extension from d2) [6th = skip before the hit for 7th]

- instruments added this new chord MIDI onto:
  - piano 1: the piano we have been using all day
  - piano 2: new (upbeat piano)
  - cello: new (deep strings basically)
  - sine wave bass: we have used this before (adding it here to add weight)
    - midi: the bottom notes legato 2x ie. a0/1, c1/2, d1/2, f1/2
  

Drop after the pad section:
- Kick
- Piano 1 playing rhythmic chords
- Sine wave bass playing rhythmic bass pattern (not legato midi notes like in pad section)
- Counter melody strings
  - he hesisates to use the whole time
  - ends up using them halfway ie. after 4 bars


### Arrangement

Note: If you have not arranged your vocals yet, it is time to do that here (Before laying down the rest of the elements, at least get a rough sketch!)

Note: If you do not know how to write a piano house bassline, ...


Intro for mixing in (33-41):
- Vocal fills
- Kick
- Piano 1 in chill mode (filter it up with LPF too so it comes in)
- Hi string

Verse (41-49):
- Vocals
- Piano 2, but Chill Piano

Pre-Chorus (49-57):
- Vocals
- Kick
- Piano 2, but vocal level/Mid piano
- new additions: (without these it is essentially the same 8 bars as before...)
  - Sine wave bass notes (not legato - works well with left hand of )
  - creep in hi strings (vocal is already going high)

1st Chorus ie. Drop 1a (57-65):
- Vocals
- Kick
- Bass
- Drums
- Piano 1
- Strings counter melody

Pad section (65-73):
- Vocal snippets
- No bass
- Drums in 2nd half (hat and clap)
- Piano sine bass
- Piano 1 w/ legato
- Piano 2 ie. upbeat new piano w/ legato
- Cello

2nd Chorus ie. Drop 1b (73-81):
- Kick
- Piano 1
- Piano 2
- Strings counter melody in 2nd half

Pre-Chorus (81-89):
- Vocals
- Kick
- Bass
- Drums
- Piano 2

Chorus ie. Drop 2a (89-97):
- Vocals
- Kick
- Bass
- Drums
- Piano 1
- Strings counter melody

Pad section (97-105):
- Same as first pad section ie. 65-73
  - might but less drums but idk
  - correction: add in kick for all 8, drums come in after 4 again (can take claps out if you want)

2nd Chorus ie. Drop 2a (105-113):
- Vocal fills ie. "we both going high away"
- Kick
- Bass
- Drums
- Piano 1
- Strings counter melody


Last second addition: add a high string
- simple: open your MIDI to the root note 1 in a high octave ie. A4
- works in all chorus in pad section ie. it is in 33-41 intro, 57-81, off from 81-89 in the pre-chorus, back from 89-113
- automate gain up in drop 2b


### Finishing Touches

High sprinkle sound on the "roads"

Arp down chord:
- 16th note grid, a5-e5-c5-a4 with space between each note (starts at 1.3, ends around 2.1)
  - this goes off at 49, 53, 

Arp up chord (we are missing brightness in the chorus now, so let's do this but opposite)
- 16th note grid, pentatonic ie. 5 note scale using 1-3-4-5-7
  - a4-c5-d5-e5-a5 (i think he meant g5)
  - velocity 91 to turn it dow n
  - this goes off as fills right before 57, 61, 65, 69, then again for 89,93,97,101,105,109

## How To Convert Vocals to Midi in your DAW and Find the Key

[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fO7jGAz7LC4)

Need:
1. Must have pitch!
- rap/spoken vocal has no key, so won't be good (those will fit over anything, enjoy!)
  - autotune/vocoder is the exception

2. Dry vocal
- no ambient effects ie. echo/delay/reverb (it confuses the algorithm)

3. Un-messed with
- no time stretch, pitch manipulation (need original signal)
- wav > mp3

4. Solo vocal
- if it was double/tripled, not good (confuses the algo)


With that out of the way, we have the best chance for Ableton to work!


Steps:
1. Drag audio onto midi track with an instrument loaded -> Press 'melody'

2. Find the home note:
- try and identify where the vocal has come to a rest (subjective, but where it 'finds home')
- example: end of phrase is a return to home
  - whether it is up or down
- example: note it spends the most time on
- in his example: where the lady sings "fight" and "cry" because they end the phrases, or "eyes" because that ends a phrase
  - guesses: b/e (because in the midi those are where those end up)

3. Use the hack
- find the key: take the entire phrase, shift it so the home note is on A or C
  - what are looking for: do most of the pitches land on white notes
    - 
- find the major/minor of the key: 
  - major: more white notes when home note (e) is on c
  - minor: more white notes when home note (e) is on a
  

- repeat the rules: which has more white notes? (ie. where does it fit best and have the least black keys)
  - home note moved to A = minor key
  - home note moved to C = major key
  - neither: try another home note
  

Example 2: Overdrive
- notes:
  - phrases ending on f#
  - mostly goes above f# then comes down (spends the most time on g#)

- our 2 guesses: f# and g#:
  - g#: 
    - on c: 11 notes on black
    - on a: 6 notes on black

  - f#: 
    - on c: 11 notes on black
    - on a: 4 notes on black

- answer: f#min


Example 3:
- notes:
  - phrases ending on e
  - mostly sits on e
  - after e did not work: next suspicion is D because the phrase ends d-e, d is a long note and e is a flicker

- our 2 guesses: e and d
  - e: 
    - on c: 14 notes on black
    - on a: 7 notes on black

  - d: 
    - on c:  notes on black
    - on a:  notes on black

  - a


Something lots of people do not know: Vocals can be in multiple keys!!!
- there's only 12 notes to choose from
- most scales: use 7 notes
  - there can be overlap
  - keys can share notes, they just start in different places
  - when vocal melody is only 4-8 bars, we may not have enough notes to truly find the keys
    - most melodies do not use every note in the scale

lesson: vocals can fit over multiple keys!
- example 3: can fit on dmin or amin


Example 4:
  - repeated phrase ie. 4 bars needed not all 8
    - take the first half, it seemed more accurate
  - time spent on most: d#
  - end of phrase: c#
  - 2nd suspicion: c# (has some notes and ends the word "love" which is a mini phrase)

- our 2 guesses: d# and c#
  - d#: 
    - on c: 6 notes on black
    - on a: 2 notes on black

  - c#: 
    - on c: 2 notes on black
    - on a: 4 notes on black

- answer: D#min or C#maj


Example 5:
  - time spent on most: d#
  - end of phrase: g#

- our 2 guesses: d# and g#
  - d#: 
    - on c: 8 notes on black
    - on a: 1 notes on black

  - g#: 
    - on c:  notes on black
    - on a: 1 notes on black

- answer: D#min or G#min

Note: This is your best shot if you don't have the ear training!!!

Note: To easily see the black keys, put your scale as 'F# - Major Pentatonic'

## Bthelick - How To Drop - 3 POVs DJ Producer Musician

overaching concept: "starve and deliver"
- build: deliver ambient, starve from lows
- drop:  deliver lows, starve from ambience

### DJ

POV = dj: with limited toolset, you get creative!
what we have: 1 sample, drum, bass from odd mob
idea: manipulate sample for 1 minute, the drop the beat
automations:
start w lpf: no high frequencies to start
delay creeps in: delay complicates the groove
note: default 3/18 ie. dotted 1/8
reverb mix up: more ambience
hpf: remove low frequencies ie. starve the audience of the bass
shorten the loop
right before drop: dial it back (so they know what is coming)
drop: everything is 

### Producer

POV = producer: drum and bass producers overproduce everything LOL
- instrument changes
- drums fills, fx
- reverse the lead in
- drop the bass
- bait and switch: go from DnB to Trance

### Musician

POV = musician; back to piano house

## Hold n Fill

Steps:

- FW White noise (swiggly circles)

4. tony romera - attracted
- 

## List of songs with good crash

1. Matroda - Hazy
- crash 1 is small and good for builds
- crash 2 is great for starting an 8 bar phrase

2. 
- has a really good 4x drum fill crash

## Stutter House Ingredients & Sound Design PT1

### Overview

Tempo: 120-132 BPM
Groove: Straight OR Swung
Key: Any
Stems: Drums, Bass, Pads, Vocals

### Drums and Groove

One drum kit: Just altering little things to make it fit a song

While watching this video, I saw that Bthelick had applied the groove 'Swing 16-45' to each clip, and was automating the Groove pool's amount via the top left corner of Ableton.
- Also can be automated with the value 'Global Amount' which will start at 100% (bottom right of groove pool)
- Make sure that each MIDI clip has 'Swing 16-45'
  - Meaning:
    - at 100%, the total amount of swing on all parts is 45%
    - at 50%, the total amount of swing on all parts is all 50% of that 45% that swing template ie. 22.5%
    - at 0%, we are straight

Takeaways:
- kick: 
  - kick house: normal kick (in mono)
  - kick 808: boomy kick with ableton 808 core kit
- tops:
  - clap: "back beat"
    - tom bump: 
    - clap 1: messy clap
    - clap 2: thin/stock 909 clap
      - reverb on claps to emphasize the backbeat
  - hats: ""
    - offbeat ie. after every kick
      - hat1: open hi hat ie. longer noizu type
      - offhat: light hi hat
        - heavy offbeat with a loud hat1
    - skippy or 1/16 hats:
      - hats: 1/16th note 909 closed hats
      - skip: syncopated skip snares
        - backs up the break
      - lighttop: light top loop
      - break: sounds like DnB drums
        - loud in fred again sound
      - 16s: 1/16th note 808 closed hats (thinner/brighter than the thick 909s)
        - change velocity of the pattern of 4 hits
      - shake: 1/16th pattern, for extra sizzle
        - change shakers and velocity

- groove:
  - pop house ie. chainsmokers: straight ie 0% swing, 1/16th notes on hats + shakers drive the groove (no heavy accent on hi hats or backbeat/claps)
  - tight/skippy groove with swing ie. otto knows: 91% swing, no long hi hats, short claps, short kick, lots of swing comes from broken up "break", 1/16s and shakers swing helps too
  - tom led groove straight ie. dzeko: normal kick, tom, dry/short claps, lite offbeat hi hats, usual rolling 16 + short shaker (keeps groove tight), 909 closed hi hat
  - syncopated (is this house?) ie. Fred Again: break with syncopated accents, swing, top bump, normal kick, medium claps, lite offbeat hi hat, no shakers

### Bass Sounds

3 types of Bass:

1. Pad type ie. long sustained stuff

"Bass Pad Thick":
- Osc1: Saw wave, 9 voices, unison detune
- Osc2: Saw wave, 16 voices, Octave up, unison detune
- Osc3: Sine wave, Rand 0 ie. in phase, to back up the saws (detuning the saw waves makes the sub weak due to phase cancellation, so we add sine wave at lowest fundamental frequency)
- Filter: Low pass ~250 Hz
  - Can automate if you want with the envelope, but not necessary

MIDI: Holding long notes w/ moving chord progressions
- Example - Bicep: 1-7-5-6 in Emin (1 per bar)
- Example - Dzeko: 6-1-7-4 in G#min (2 per bar, dips down to 3 ie. B for last 1/2 bar of 4)
- Example - Fred Again: 6-7-1-3 in Fmin
    

Note: Still good idea to put sub on separate track, so we can sidechain it separately! (Put them all together for tutorial)

2. Rolling bass ie. 1/16th note groove
- 2 methods:
  - PokeySawWave: Short notes
  - using sustain notes and a "trigger"

"PokeySawWave"
- Osc1: Saw wave mixed with triangle (Classic Blend in Vital)
- Osc2: More analog saw (ESW Analog in Vital - ARP Saw from EchoSoundWorksPack/Classic Arp2600)
- Osc3: White noise to help add attack
- Filter: Low pass ~
- Amp Envelope: Short decay ~33%, some sustain ~66%, sends to filter cutoff for low/mid punch
- Env2: Even shorter envelope going to the filter cutoff to give more attack (Short decay ~25%, some sustain ~0%)
  - No wrong/right way to do these envelopes
- FX:
  - Distortion: Drive ~60%, Mix 100%
  - EQ: Resonance 50% for poke in mids
    - Note: Reference the tracks for cutoff values and whatnot, and do trial and error until we get close!

MIDI: Short notes, doesn't require any audio stuffer because of how they are written (And having a synth with short release)
- 1/16 note grid, not full notes but 50-75% way there

Note: Uses stereofaker ie. 'BtheLick - Stereo Faker' for width

2. Option 2 - using sustain notes and a "trigger"
- Osc1: Grimey sound from a more complex waveform ie. not saw/sine/square (Bass house, dubstep vibes), Phase locked ie. 0
- Osc2: Saw wave, to back up the grimey sound, Phase locked ie. 0
- Osc3: Sine wave for the bass, same as #1 you can split this out in its own track
- Noise: White Noise
- Amp Envelope: ~33% Sustain/Decay/Release ie. smooth shape
- FX:
  - Distortion: Drive ~60%, Mix 100%
  - EQ: Top bark

Note: 

3. Classic house bass ie. bouncy kind "bounce bass"
- 2 types:
  - bouncey
  - chainsmokers unforgetable FM bass
  
Couldn't make these patches, so I used:
- EvoSounds Deceiver 5 - "BA - Dahmer Heartbeat" OR Loud Luxury these nights slap bass
- Sam Smyers - Viral Sounds Collection - Armin Van Buuren "BS On & On [Sam Smyers]"

Note: If you are moving notes in your bass, do not EQ the low-end (It is dependent on key/notes, will end up with an uneven low-end)

## Stutter House Ingredients & Sound Design PT2

### Pads + Chords

Pianos: 
- spitfire audio free plugin

Pads: 
- often do not contain bass notes (leave those for the bass)
  - can always put the bass note back in the pad for breaks (when bass is off)



### Vocals

Surprise: all of the vocals are the same!
- long steady note
- "feeeeeeeeeeee" from word feel 

Bicep chain:
- pitch from G#/Ab to E
  - found real vocal by using piano to see it was in E
- reverb
- delay
- stutter
- sidechain
- more reverb! (added ambience, in case stutter makes it too dry)


Takeaway: Using clip pitch automation, match the chord progression

Formants: harmonic structure related to the human voice
- think like this: how you hear the "character" in somebody's voice
- when you pitch up a voice: chipmunk
- when you pitch down: darth vader
  - if you fix formants, it will sound more natural
  
- why the science lesson? use to our advantage!
  - if we want vocals to sound pitched, but they are already at the correct pitch! (mess with formant shift)

- khs formant filter: "The Formant Filter will boost two frequencies to mimic the sounds of different vowels."

### Leads

Briefly mention: Most songs did NOT have leads

Fred Again: Actual lead
- 'NotFred' in Vital

Sort of leads:

Dzeko - Ascend: Background atmos sound / ambient background sound (leave the pulse pad front and center)
- 'DistantFlute'

Sound design tip: For flutes, hallow sounds ie. square/triangle are a good place to start (he mixed with some noice, then chorus, delay, reverb)

### SFX

Cymbals and noise, nothing specific to this genre!

### Cooking Your Ingredients!

Now that he has all of these elements already, he just has to pick his favorites and he has a track!

Drums: Fred Again, but less reliant on 'break' and more on hi hats
Vocals: took little sections and put where it sounded good
  - muted sections to experiment with 
  - formants shifted down to have 
- Chord Prog: 6-1-7-5
- Bass: Rolling style from Otto Knows (short notes)
  - staying on root notes, with passing notes between vocals (experiment!)
- Pads: 4 chords
  - some have 6/7ths on top (to make common tones ie. an E droning through)
- Stuffer effect: Funky pattern with Gate method 
  - more interesting than a static 1/16th (you can make new rhythms)
- Lead: 'Bendy lead'
  - DistantFlute from Dzeko: (is smooth without the stuffer effect)

## K+B Feedback

### Myles Thomas - Dance Like You Don't Care (Used John Summit La Danza)

Feedback from Malcolm Zeller (I am transcribing video into text):
- percussion/groove is cool, but some are out of time
  - remedy: make sure everything is quantized ie. lining up
- too much reverb on clap
- pick a different kick
  - this is very important for a clean mix
- better piano sound
  - arturia piano sound lab for clean sounding 
- vocal is out of key
- another good reference to use: summertime chi by john summit
- nice job on the bassline!
- let the groove breath
  - less melodic stuff in the drop

Ending thoughts:
- nice work on bassline + chords
- work on sound selection
  - kick
  - some drum sounds ie. hat that is less tambourine sounding
- fix vocal to be in-key
- give more room for groove in the drop
 

### Lil Wayne - Cry For Me Remix

Feedback from coach Millean:

Your feedback has been completed ✅
Congrats! Millean reviewed your track and the following notes were made:
Overall thoughts:
yoooooo here's some fresh feedback for you
Key areas to improve:
this mix needs to be redone! you're clipping when the bass and kick play together
don't put so much reverb on your drums
maybe leave a filtered kick or some drum elements in the break to keep the dance floor moving
The break is a bit too difficult I think, so many words, different flows. Iw Ould just take like 2 sentences that are really catchy and make a chop/cool phrase with that. Its house music keep it simple!
main synth needs to pop out way more in the mix. Use imaging and saturation
side chain the bass with the kick more
cool chords & synth melody
that last vocal pitch sounds pretty weird I wouldn't do that (last buildup)
overal I get your idea and it's pretty cool. I just think you haven't been producing for super long and that's ok! just keep grinding g, make more tunes watch more tutorials. Hone your skills and keep it up

### Myles Thomas - My Way (Used Joel Corry - Dance Around it)

Feedback from coach zookeeper:
- i like the paul wolford vibes
- kick is quiet, bass is loud (switch that out)
  - watch his foolproof method on how to balance kick/bass

- bass is especially loud when it comes in (eats up the mix) 
- 0:44 ie drop: have low end out before this 
  - too much bass for little drum action
- 1:15 ie. breakdown/verse 2: lose the clap, just have the kick, filter the piano
  - lots of piano, so filter that out
- get rid of cowbell as much (it is loud)
- chorus: all you did was add a ride, try to do more
  - begging for counter-melody in drop 1b/2b

Ending thoughts:
- kick + bass balance
- get a counter melody
- play with instrumentation in verse1
- try filtering piano/muting clap in the 2nd verse
- it is not far off!

### Missy Elliott - Work It Remix

Feedback from coach Anatta:
- turn down fx (this makes it commercial ie not underground)
- shaker is pretty far back
- groove has to be more dramatic if you want to do bass/stiff drums
  - "yours feels very stiff"
- master is pretty blown
  - underground: don't worry about loudness
  - aim for -8 LUFS
- more "out there" percussion
  - yours is very american tech-house ish
  - need more identity to stand out
- if you want underground, need less release on hats/claps (they are full)
- synth is buried, give saturation for more overtones

Ending thoughts:
- i don't want underground i guess lol

## Kickstart Your DJ Career - Anatta

From Square 1 (brand new project) -> Doing well on Spotify -> Getting into local scene -> Getting into different markets ie. Festivals

1. start looking at it as a job
- you get to have fun, but there is much more
- things you need to do:
    - be very organized
    - establish goals

things for new producers:
1. get press photos
- if you play anywhere/sign a song, you will need press photos
- workshop the vibe/brand you are looking to have for your project

2. EPK
- dropbox folder, then a 1 sheet (PDF document)

3. Website
- grab a domain or linktree
- allows everybody to find all of your happenings

---

2. goals
- support
- venues
- metrics
- labels

note: have realistic goals
- small/medium/large

3. promoters
- doesn't have to be as robust initially
- premise: 
    - if you are new: focus on home market
    - for anatta: arizona minimal tech events

- variables/columns:
    - state
    - market
    - party/event
    - venue
    - company
    - hard/soft ticket:
        - hard ticket: headliner is responsible for all ticket sales (think big venue like Radius)
            - "i don't think my value in this market is worth 1000 tickets"
        - soft ticket: no matter who is playing, there is a built-in crowd (think Tao/PRYSM)
            - may do a soft ticket party to introduce into market, still a good show
    - tickets sold
    - play date
    - first/last name: your contact with this event
    - role:
        - what your contact does

takeaways:

  - the bigger guys are getting editorial/spotify support, you can't get in contact with them
  2. find the 'discovered on' section
  - playlist: Techno House 2024
  3. find the person who runs the playlist
  - example: Texture Papier Records
  4. reach out to them to find out how much it costs to submit
  - do this on release date

- places to do this:

  - deezer
  - apple music

- takeaways:
  - lots of people will not reply (numbers game, you will have to reach out a lot)

---

6. dj list

## Sam Smyers - How to Use Multiband Dynamics in Ableton Live 11 - Everything You Need to Know

Types of processing:
1. Upward Compression: make quiet signals louder
- signal falls below threshold, it goes UP
- example: 

2. Downward Compression: make loud signals quieter
- signal goes above threshold, it goes DOWN
- example: 

3. Upward Expansion: make loud signals louder
- signal goes above threshold, it goes UP
- example: 

4. Downward Expansion: make quiet signals quieter
- signal falls below threshold, it goes DOWN
- example: noise gate

Compression: Reduces dynamic range

Expansion: Increases dynamic range

![definitions for compression/expansion](sam_smyers_multiband_dynamics_1.png)

![Upward/Downward Compression](sam_smyers_multiband_dynamics_2.png)

![Upward/Downward Expansion](sam_smyers_multiband_dynamics_3.png)


How to use the plugin:
- Bands: High/Mid/Low
  - Standard: 200Hz, 2000Hz
  - Can mute/solo/turn off bands if you want
  
- 3 Input Knobs: boost or attenuate the level of each band before it undergoes dynamics processing
- 3 Output Knobs: same, but after processing

- 3 Input Bars (Left): Controls the 'Below' settings
- 3 Output Bars (Right): Controls the 'Above' settings

- Soft Knee: apply the compression gradually until the full ratio amount is reached
  - On: Compression/Expansion will make the transition from uncompressed to compressed smoother and more transparent.
  - Off: (preferred)
- RMS/Peak: Decide how it reacts to short peaks
  - RMS: react slower to peaks
  - Peak: react quicker to peaks (preferred)

- Output Knob: 
- Time: Scale attack/release time for each band
- Amount: Run plugin in parallel

- T/B/A:
  - T (Time): set attack/release
    - attack: how fast compression/expansion applies (10-20ms)
    - release how fast compression/expansion restores back to normal level (100-200ms)
  
  - B (Below): affects quieter signals (below threshold set)
    - ratio above 1 (ie. 1:3.00): make quiet signals louder (upward compression)
    - ratio above 1 (ie. 1:0.50): make quiet signals quieter (downward expansion)
    
  - A (Above): affects louder signals (above threshold set)
    - ratio above 1 (ie. 1:Inf): make loud signals quieter (downward compression)
    - ratio above 1 (ie. 1:0.71): make loud signals louder (upward expansion)

- Sidechain:
  - 
  - Example: Sidechain the bass to the kick (Lower the volume of the low end of bass, leave mid/hi alone)
    - Input: Kick
    - Deactivate mid/high bands
    - Mode: Above
      - Ratio: 1:Inf
      - Threshold: -44db (Compress anything above this to go down in volume)
    - Mode: Time:
      - fast attack: 3ms
      - fast release: 1ms 
      

My research now: What in the hell does OTT.adv do?
- Bands: 88 Hz, 2500 Hz
- Input knobs: Bring up all bands before processing, highs the most
- Output knobs: Bring up all bands before processing, highs then lows the most
- T: Quicker attacks, slower release
- B:
  - Thresholds: -40dB ie. anything below -40dB is affected
  - Ratios: 1:4:17 ie. anything below -40dB is now louder
- A:
  - Thresholds: -35dB ie. anything above -35dB is affected
  - Ratios: 1:Inf ie. anything above -35dB is now MUCH quieter

## Zen World - My Kick and Bass Sounded Horrible Until I Did This (Multiband Dynamics Trick)

zen world - multiband dynamics - tighter/punchier bass

link: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uOKCEmWDc5A

steps:
1. adjust the 'above' ratio for low frequencies
- increase ratio of bottom right bar to ~1:2.30
- this is applying 'downward compression' ie. making anything louder than -17dB, more quiet (for the frequency range of < 120Hz)

2. fix attack/release:
- attack: ~30dB
- release: ~80dB

3. dial in the amount of gain reduction by adjusting the threshold +/- 17db
- aim for ~3dB gain reduction (will see this on left side)
- then, compensate with 3db makeup gain on output knob

what this does:
1: kick will sound better
2. bass gets more presence

## How to get a triplet grid (Good for fills, etc.)

(I thought I had written this down already, but I guess not...)

Method #1: Do it by eye
- Instructions:
  - Create 1 note, triple it out
  - Repeat until you are very close to exactly at the end of the clip
- Quick, not as on the grid (human-like feel could be good tho...)

Method #2: Turn your MIDI clip into a triplet grid
- Instructions:
  - Open a new MIDI Clip
  - Click on the grid -> Ctrl-3 (Or, right click on the notes grid -> Triplet grid)
  - Draw in 3 evenly sized notes 
- More precise, takes longer to setup

Problem: Splice's file directory is shit

Prompt to ChatGPT:

```
write me a script that will allow me to move all items from subfolders recursively back into the main folder

example: I have a 'music samples' folder with samples from a bunch of different packs/people on Splice, and I want all of the samples (ie. .mp3/.wav files) to be in 1 big folder (instead of spread out)

```

Python script:


```py
# move_files.py
import os
import shutil
from datetime import datetime

def move_files_to_main_folder(main_folder):
    if not os.path.exists(main_folder):
        print(f"The folder '{main_folder}' does not exist.")
        return

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(main_folder):
        if root != main_folder:
            print(root)
            print(dirs)
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                new_file_path = file_path
                
                
                # If file already exists, append timestamp
                if os.path.exists(new_file_path):
                    new_file_name = os.path.basename(root) + "_" + file
                    new_file_path = os.path.join(main_folder, new_file_name)
                    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M%S")
                    base, ext = os.path.splitext(new_file_name)
                    new_file_name = f"{base}_{timestamp}{ext}"
                    new_file_path = os.path.join(main_folder, new_file_name)

                shutil.move(file_path, new_file_path)

            # Remove empty directories
            for dir in dirs:
                dir_path = os.path.join(root, dir)
                try:
                    os.rmdir(dir_path)
                    print(f"removed dir {dir} ...")
                except OSError:

    main_folder = "C:/Users/Myles/Documents/Splice/Samples/packs"
    move_files_to_main_folder(main_folder)
    print("task completed!")


```

Instructions:
0. Update Python file to point to your local Splice folder 
- Mine: `main_folder = C:\Users\Myles\Documents\Splice\Samples\packs`

1. Save Python file anywhere on your local device
- Mine is here: C:\Users\Myles\OneDrive\Documents\Music\move_files.py

2. Run the file!

```sh
cd "C:\Users\Myles\OneDrive\Documents\Music"
python move_files.py

ChatGPT prompt:

write me a python script that has 4 command line arguments:
1. path of folder
2. substring to look for in file name
3. n (number of files)
4. name of new folder

write a script that goes to the path, finds all files with a match ie. has the substring in the filename, randomly picks n of those files, and copies the files randomly chosen into a new empty folder

Python script:

```py
# copy_random_files.py
import os
import shutil
import argparse
import random

def main(path, substring, n, new_folder):
    # Ensure the path exists
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        print(f"Error: The folder {path} does not exist.")
        return

    # Get all files that contain the substring in their name
    files = [f for f in os.listdir(path) if substring in f]

    # If not enough files are found, print a message and exit
    if len(files) < n:
        print(f"Error: Only found {len(files)} files containing '{substring}', but {n} are needed.")
        return

    # Randomly select n files from the list
    selected_files = random.sample(files, n)

    # Create the new folder if it does not exist
    if not os.path.exists(new_folder):
        os.makedirs(new_folder)

    # Copy the selected files to the new folder
    for file in selected_files:
        src_path = os.path.join(path, file)
        dst_path = os.path.join(new_folder, file)
        shutil.copy2(src_path, dst_path)

    print(f"Successfully copied {n} files to {new_folder}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Copy random files with a specific substring in the filename.")
    parser.add_argument("path", type=str, help="Path of the folder to search for files.")
    parser.add_argument("substring", type=str, help="Substring to look for in file names.")
    parser.add_argument("n", type=int, help="Number of files to copy.")
    parser.add_argument("new_folder", type=str, help="Name of the new folder to copy files into.")

    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args.path, args.substring, args.n, args.new_folder)

## Dealing with issue where File -> Collect and Save All does NOT work

Steps:
1. Find all files that are being troublesome
- ie. they have too long of paths to copy

2. Close project file (can do 'File -> New Live Set')

3. Move these files to a shorter path
- ie. `Downloads`

4. Rename them to have short paths
- Example: `OneRepublic - All The Right Moves (Official Music Vi_vocals_split_by_lalalai` -> `OneRepublicVox`
- Example 2: `Florence + The Machine - Dog Days Are Over (TWINSICK Remix) - G# - 130.00` -> `DogDaysRemixTWINSICK`

5. Open back up that project

6. Fix the 'Media files are missing'
<!-- - Set folder to Downloads -> Automatic Search -> Go -->
- Drag files by hand from `Downloads`

7. File -> Collect All and Save

Good to go!

Ladies and gentlemen, we are back with some more reverse Ableton (mirror ableton)

Steps:
0. Setup MiniMeters correctly
- On the line where the music is currently playing, that is the mid point (THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR IT TO LOOK GOOD)
  - Left: Spectrogram
  - Right: Waveforms
  - MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ARE SKINNY ENOUGH SO THAT WHEN ZOOMED IN IT LOOKS FINE (may need to reference old/play around here)

1. Record with RecMaster
- Program window: Full Screen
- Put At top, just above reference track
- Make sure you can see all tracks, if possible (Do Alt-T to minimize stuff, leave open leads/basses if you want)
- Remember to change to DirectX for Audio output
- Make sure that the window moves when you press play (You will be zooming in when you post to IG because of a phone being 1080x1920 instead of wide desktop)
- Make sure Master channel is minimized
- Once done recording, edit/crop video to just what is needed

2. Canva
- Create a design -> Videos -> Mobile Videos
- Upload video from above
- Mirror it (Flip -> Horizontal)
  - Re-adjust the centering after flipping, as this will mess it up
- Export MP4

3. Upload to Google drive

4. Download from iPhone

5. Post from IG on your iPhone
